1
00:02:01,486 --> 00:02:04,814
Shit. Shit. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

2
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:07,640
It's okay.
I have another one.

3
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:09,481
All right.

4
00:02:12,851 --> 00:02:14,248
Slow down.

5
00:02:14,317 --> 00:02:15,945
Just follow me.

6
00:02:16,217 --> 00:02:17,614
You like that?

7
00:02:18,784 --> 00:02:21,341
Tell me you like it.

8
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,780
I just did.

9
00:02:33,182 --> 00:02:34,705
Please don't tell me you're taking
lessons from that Neanderthal.

10
00:02:34,782 --> 00:02:36,839
No. No.

11
00:02:36,915 --> 00:02:39,380
Good. I want us to be special.

12
00:02:49,947 --> 00:02:52,845
That's disgusting.

13
00:02:52,914 --> 00:02:54,777
Hey, let's explore.

14
00:03:12,411 --> 00:03:15,070
Marco.

15
00:03:21,511 --> 00:03:22,807
Hey, what's the holdup?
This sucks.

16
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:23,968
Why is there traffic?

17
00:03:24,043 --> 00:03:25,475
What is going on?
What is that?

18
00:03:25,544 --> 00:03:26,941
This is crazy.

19
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,374
A spokesman released a statement

20
00:03:28,444 --> 00:03:29,500
10 minutes ago

21
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:33,338
saying that the quarantine exercise
will be for 24 hours...

22
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:35,068
Charlie 1-4, this is Charlie...

23
00:03:35,143 --> 00:03:37,006
We have visual contact.

24
00:03:37,076 --> 00:03:39,564
We got reservations at 7.
You mean to tell me we can't get through?

25
00:03:39,642 --> 00:03:41,505
This is bullshit. Bullshit.

26
00:03:41,575 --> 00:03:43,632
You can't do this.
We're in America.

27
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:45,607
Who gave the order
for this exercise?

28
00:03:45,675 --> 00:03:48,004
Sir, my orders are to keep
this road sealed off

29
00:03:48,075 --> 00:03:49,631
for the next 24 hours.

30
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:52,004
You can take your son
to the hospital in town.

31
00:03:52,075 --> 00:03:54,302
Those guys don't know their asses
from a hole in the ground.

32
00:03:54,374 --> 00:03:55,601
I want to go to a real hospital.

33
00:03:55,674 --> 00:03:57,071
Sir, I understand.

34
00:03:57,141 --> 00:03:59,164
Not unless you have kids,
you don't fucking understand.

35
00:03:59,241 --> 00:04:01,604
Honey, you're not helping.

36
00:04:01,673 --> 00:04:03,571
We're going to Boulder.

37
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,901
Corporal Cross? Platoon up.

38
00:04:06,973 --> 00:04:09,837
You heard the man.
Let's go. Let's go.

39
00:04:09,906 --> 00:04:12,065
Sir, I'm asking you politely.

40
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,935
Please turn your car around. Please.

41
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:23,462
Mrs. Leitner?
What?

42
00:04:23,538 --> 00:04:25,595
Sarah, what are you doing here?

43
00:04:25,671 --> 00:04:27,432
Your mom told me
you were never coming back.

44
00:04:27,505 --> 00:04:30,198
Well, you know how she exaggerates.

45
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:32,327
Besides, I'm needed here.

46
00:04:32,403 --> 00:04:33,960
Look, I'm sorry that I yelled,

47
00:04:34,037 --> 00:04:36,298
but can you get us out of here?

48
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,801
Cody is really sick.

49
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,530
Mr. Leitner, I understand
that you're upset,

50
00:04:39,603 --> 00:04:42,126
but the best thing that
you can do for Cody right now

51
00:04:42,203 --> 00:04:43,395
is to get him
to the medical center.

52
00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:45,230
The Army's
brought in specialists.

53
00:04:45,302 --> 00:04:47,063
They're already there
at the hospital.

54
00:04:47,136 --> 00:04:49,227
That'll be much quicker
than driving to Boulder.

55
00:04:49,302 --> 00:04:51,665
She's right.

56
00:04:51,735 --> 00:04:52,928
Thank you.

57
00:05:00,368 --> 00:05:02,765
All right, get the rest
of these cars turned around.

58
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:04,027
Okay, you heard the captain.

59
00:05:04,101 --> 00:05:05,862
Let's get all of the cars turned around.

60
00:05:05,934 --> 00:05:07,263
Excuse me, sir.

61
00:05:07,334 --> 00:05:09,357
Sir.

62
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,865
Did I just tell them the truth?

63
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:15,194
Corporal, your orders are
to keep this shit hole town...

64
00:05:15,266 --> 00:05:18,289
Excuse me.
Your shit hole town sealed off.

65
00:05:18,366 --> 00:05:19,525
Now do it.

66
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,997
Yes, sir.

67
00:05:21,066 --> 00:05:23,157
0616, over.

68
00:05:23,632 --> 00:05:25,289
Yeah, where the hell
are those med'chines?

69
00:05:25,365 --> 00:05:27,058
They were supposed to
be here 3 hours ago.

70
00:05:27,132 --> 00:05:28,359
They haven't reported in, sir.

71
00:05:28,432 --> 00:05:29,988
We've got teams searching now.

72
00:05:30,065 --> 00:05:31,963
No. Both of them?

73
00:05:42,696 --> 00:05:43,992
Nina?

74
00:06:04,628 --> 00:06:06,253
Nina?

75
00:06:07,928 --> 00:06:09,757
Hello.

76
00:06:13,427 --> 00:06:15,916
Gotcha!

77
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:20,116
I got you.

78
00:06:20,193 --> 00:06:22,489
Not really.
Yeah, right.

79
00:06:25,693 --> 00:06:27,386
What'd you find?

80
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:30,152
I don't know.

81
00:06:30,226 --> 00:06:31,487
You want to check it out?

82
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:34,388
Find a cool little spot?

83
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:38,720
In a dark hole?
I don't think so.

84
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,418
Hey, didn't you
say something

85
00:06:41,492 --> 00:06:44,287
about your mother
being sick with the flu?

86
00:06:44,358 --> 00:06:46,755
Yeah, she's in bed.

87
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:49,722
You think she'd know
if we were on your couch?

88
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,288
Zip it up, Kyle.

89
00:06:52,357 --> 00:06:53,947
What?

90
00:06:54,023 --> 00:06:55,852
We're out of here.
Come on.

91
00:06:57,623 --> 00:06:58,714
I'm not really done here.

92
00:07:01,356 --> 00:07:03,981
You want a ride? You're done.

93
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:08,316
Your friend's a real buzz kill.

94
00:07:08,388 --> 00:07:10,149
Tell me about it.

95
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:14,878
Oh, God.

96
00:07:17,721 --> 00:07:18,948
Jesus, you okay, man?

97
00:07:22,554 --> 00:07:24,315
Chill. It stopped.
Are you my mom?

98
00:07:24,387 --> 00:07:26,216
Okay, okay, come on. We gotta go.

99
00:07:26,287 --> 00:07:28,479
Nina and I have, you know, plans.

100
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,515
My parents aren't getting home
for a couple of hours.

101
00:07:35,586 --> 00:07:36,813
Want to come over?

102
00:07:36,886 --> 00:07:38,977
Are you nuts?

103
00:07:39,053 --> 00:07:40,678
If you got me sick, I'll kill you.

104
00:07:40,753 --> 00:07:41,684
No.

105
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,548
Come on, Kyle! Bus is leaving!

106
00:07:43,618 --> 00:07:44,709
Let's go!
Wait!

107
00:07:44,785 --> 00:07:46,648
This is KSWT, broadcasting live

108
00:07:46,718 --> 00:07:49,149
from downtown Leadville, Colorado.

109
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,047
So I have some travel news

110
00:07:51,118 --> 00:07:53,448
for all of you trying to get out of town.

111
00:07:53,518 --> 00:07:56,813
Route 40 will be closed
until 7:30 tomorrow night.

112
00:07:56,884 --> 00:08:01,213
Still, they keep saying
this is just an exercise.

113
00:08:01,283 --> 00:08:04,078
Now, Uncle Sam wouldn't be
trying to lie to us, would he?

114
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,513
No. Stay tuned for further bulletins.

115
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:11,140
In the meantime, when the man
gives them to me,

116
00:08:11,216 --> 00:08:13,079
I'll give them to you.

117
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:16,911
And now, some more
inane bull stuff.

118
00:08:16,982 --> 00:08:21,004
So, as a cog in the military
industrial complex,

119
00:08:21,081 --> 00:08:22,547
are you capable of
independent thought?

120
00:08:22,615 --> 00:08:24,842
Sir, my orders are to relay
the information to you

121
00:08:24,914 --> 00:08:26,573
so you can pass it on
to the public.

122
00:08:26,647 --> 00:08:29,045
This ain't about
that flu thing, is it?

123
00:08:29,115 --> 00:08:30,910
So what the fuck
is it about?

124
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,574
You are gonna talk to me,
so help me God.

125
00:08:36,646 --> 00:08:40,601
Or...Celine Dion.

126
00:08:41,613 --> 00:08:43,511
You probably like her.

127
00:08:48,479 --> 00:08:49,843
Well, hey, come on.

128
00:08:49,912 --> 00:08:52,002
You know, it was just my allergies.

129
00:08:52,078 --> 00:08:53,704
Look, I'll give you money.

130
00:08:53,778 --> 00:08:54,801
What?

131
00:08:54,878 --> 00:08:56,741
Well... Fuck you.

132
00:08:56,811 --> 00:08:58,470
I'm walking home.

133
00:09:06,777 --> 00:09:08,902
Where'd she go?

134
00:09:08,977 --> 00:09:11,306
She said she needed
some exercise.

135
00:09:25,242 --> 00:09:27,537
We're so over, Kyle.

136
00:09:30,508 --> 00:09:31,997
Kyle?

137
00:10:28,635 --> 00:10:30,498
Hey, Private,
why don't you be all you can be

138
00:10:30,569 --> 00:10:32,001
and grab them damn batteries?

139
00:10:37,235 --> 00:10:40,224
Can you believe they're
gonna give that bitch a gun?

140
00:10:44,201 --> 00:10:45,792
Get this to Captain Rhodes
as soon as you can.

141
00:10:45,867 --> 00:10:47,856
Corporal Cross.

142
00:10:47,934 --> 00:10:50,298
We were given orders
to report to your squad.

143
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,498
Think I'm gonna like it here.

144
00:10:56,567 --> 00:10:58,725
You were at Fort Bragg, right?

145
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,197
Yes.

146
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:01,323
Yeah, I heard about you.

147
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:03,228
You and my homie Henry Fat

148
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:06,094
was hitting it for
a couple months, right?

149
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,529
You and your homie
got your wires crossed.

150
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:09,530
It didn't happen.

151
00:11:09,598 --> 00:11:10,859
If you say so.

152
00:11:10,932 --> 00:11:12,488
As of now, you two
are on guard duty.

153
00:11:12,565 --> 00:11:13,861
This is your barricade.

154
00:11:13,932 --> 00:11:16,261
No one gets through.
You got that?

155
00:11:16,331 --> 00:11:17,262
Crain, you the driver?

156
00:11:17,331 --> 00:11:18,796
Yes, sir. Um, God.

157
00:11:18,864 --> 00:11:19,795
Ma'am.

158
00:11:19,864 --> 00:11:21,727
You up for a road trip?

159
00:11:21,797 --> 00:11:22,785
Yeah.

160
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,523
No one gets through.

161
00:11:29,363 --> 00:11:30,953
How long we supposed
to stay here?

162
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,393
We'll try and be back
before breakfast.

163
00:11:32,463 --> 00:11:34,190
That's, like, 12 hours!

164
00:11:34,262 --> 00:11:36,285
We'll bring you a bagel.

165
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,453
Ahem. Are we really
spending the night together?

166
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:40,721
Not a chance.
Okay, good,

167
00:11:40,795 --> 00:11:43,556
because that wouldn't be appropriate.

168
00:11:43,628 --> 00:11:45,991
He was definitely hitting that.

169
00:11:46,061 --> 00:11:47,618
Shut up.

170
00:11:53,728 --> 00:11:55,591
I... I thought
you wanted me to drive.

171
00:11:55,661 --> 00:11:57,126
I know the way.

172
00:11:57,194 --> 00:11:58,750
You just join?

173
00:11:58,827 --> 00:12:00,656
Really? You can tell?

174
00:12:00,727 --> 00:12:02,454
Yeah, 7 months ago.

175
00:12:02,526 --> 00:12:04,152
I was studying
radar and countermeasures.

176
00:12:04,226 --> 00:12:05,988
My first time being called out.

177
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,423
Kind of wish it was something
a little more exciting.

178
00:12:08,493 --> 00:12:09,685
Be careful what you wish for.

179
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:11,782
I've seen exciting.

180
00:12:11,859 --> 00:12:13,324
You don't have to worry.

181
00:12:13,392 --> 00:12:14,881
Nothing really happens
in this town anyway.

182
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,618
Yeah, it seems
like a real shit hole.

183
00:12:18,858 --> 00:12:20,290
Where are we going anyway?

184
00:12:20,358 --> 00:12:22,017
My house.

185
00:12:23,058 --> 00:12:24,956
Oh, so you're from here?

186
00:12:25,025 --> 00:12:28,252
Born and raised.

187
00:12:28,324 --> 00:12:31,756
Well, it's kind of
a charming shit hole.

188
00:12:43,756 --> 00:12:46,551
All right, I'll be back.

189
00:12:46,622 --> 00:12:49,213
Listen,
Crain sounds so formal.

190
00:12:49,289 --> 00:12:51,221
What do your friends
call you?

191
00:12:51,289 --> 00:12:53,447
Um, my friends call me Bud.

192
00:12:53,521 --> 00:12:56,510
Bud. Okay.

193
00:12:56,588 --> 00:12:59,951
Well, when we're not around the others,
you can call me Sarah.

194
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:23,976
Nothing on TV?

195
00:13:25,186 --> 00:13:26,708
Sarah?

196
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:28,341
Haven't you heard of knocking?

197
00:13:28,418 --> 00:13:29,816
Uh, this is my house, too.

198
00:13:29,884 --> 00:13:32,850
You want privacy,
find a new place.

199
00:13:32,918 --> 00:13:35,282
What's going on, Nina?
Nothing, really.

200
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,976
Your father still
teaching Sunday school?

201
00:13:37,051 --> 00:13:38,175
This is so not cool.

202
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,307
You know what, you missed
a button right there.

203
00:13:39,384 --> 00:13:40,577
What the hell are
you doing here?

204
00:13:40,651 --> 00:13:41,775
Enforcing the quarantine.

205
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:42,941
What's up with not
returning my calls?

206
00:13:43,017 --> 00:13:44,347
What quarantine?
What calls?

207
00:13:44,417 --> 00:13:45,541
You're kidding me.

208
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,514
I called your cell phone,
like, 5 or 6 times.

209
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,776
You know what?
Where's Mom?

210
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:50,837
In bed, I guess.

211
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,439
You guess.
I just got home.

212
00:13:52,516 --> 00:13:53,504
She wasn't feeling well
this morning.

213
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:54,445
And you didn't
check on her?

214
00:13:54,515 --> 00:13:55,481
I check on her every day.

215
00:13:55,549 --> 00:13:56,480
That's a lot more
than some people.

216
00:13:56,549 --> 00:13:58,139
Get over it, Trevor.

217
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,375
Hey, Mom.

218
00:14:04,881 --> 00:14:07,040
Sarah, honey.

219
00:14:07,115 --> 00:14:09,080
I didn't know you were coming.

220
00:14:10,414 --> 00:14:13,244
I guess you were too busy to call.

221
00:14:13,314 --> 00:14:14,506
How are you feeling, Mom?

222
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,773
I'm okay.

223
00:14:15,847 --> 00:14:17,472
No, you're not.
You're burning up.

224
00:14:17,547 --> 00:14:19,513
Please, you have more
important things to do

225
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,409
than worry about me.

226
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,945
What are you doing here?

227
00:14:23,013 --> 00:14:24,274
I'm taking you to the hospital.

228
00:14:24,346 --> 00:14:26,368
Don't be silly.

229
00:14:26,446 --> 00:14:28,969
It's just a cold.
I took some vitamins.

230
00:14:29,046 --> 00:14:31,034
Mom, I'm taking you
to the hospital, okay?

231
00:14:31,112 --> 00:14:32,339
Let's get you dressed.

232
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:41,004
My dad's left a dozen messages.
They're at the hospital.

233
00:14:41,078 --> 00:14:42,203
How long has Mom been sick?

234
00:14:42,278 --> 00:14:43,766
Since this morning. It's a cold.

235
00:14:43,844 --> 00:14:45,469
Everyone's got it.
And when did you start caring?

236
00:14:45,544 --> 00:14:46,635
Don't start with me.

237
00:14:46,711 --> 00:14:47,836
Kyle had it really bad.

238
00:14:47,911 --> 00:14:49,274
His nose was gushing blood.

239
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,138
Where is he now?

240
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:53,642
Home. He found his dad's
supply of medical hash.

241
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:56,108
I'm gonna run over there
and check on him.

242
00:14:56,177 --> 00:14:57,369
Wait, wait.

243
00:14:57,443 --> 00:14:58,932
Wait, you can't even
go upstairs

244
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,202
to check on your own mother,

245
00:15:00,276 --> 00:15:02,640
and now you want to go
all the way across town?

246
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,505
No. You're gonna go upstairs,

247
00:15:05,575 --> 00:15:07,666
make sure Mom gets dressed,

248
00:15:07,742 --> 00:15:08,833
and don't leave until I get back.

249
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,636
Do you think you can handle that?

250
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,368
I'll go check on Kyle.

251
00:15:12,442 --> 00:15:15,203
Aye-aye, Admiral Bitch.

252
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,271
Everything okay?

253
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,966
No, it's not.

254
00:16:03,203 --> 00:16:05,169
Kyle.

255
00:16:05,236 --> 00:16:07,827
Anybody here?

256
00:16:16,436 --> 00:16:18,368
Oh, shit.

257
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,401
Don't worry. It's not loaded.

258
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,961
Oh, my God.

259
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,457
What the hell happened here?

260
00:17:14,896 --> 00:17:16,590
Aah! Fuck!

261
00:17:16,663 --> 00:17:19,254
Fuck!

262
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,393
What's there?

263
00:17:29,162 --> 00:17:30,093
The phone is dead.

264
00:17:30,162 --> 00:17:31,718
Fuck.

265
00:17:35,894 --> 00:17:37,383
Oh, God.

266
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,221
I don't have any service.

267
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,482
Yeah. Come on.

268
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,617
Let's go.

269
00:17:46,259 --> 00:17:48,921
Fitzsimmons,
14 Cypress Pond Road.

270
00:17:48,993 --> 00:17:50,652
The boy Kyle is missing.

271
00:17:50,726 --> 00:17:52,521
The bodies look like they
were mauled by something.

272
00:17:52,592 --> 00:17:55,149
I couldn't call the police.
All the phones are dead. Over.

273
00:17:55,225 --> 00:17:56,418
Yes, I know, Corporal.

274
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,014
We're blocking all phone lines

275
00:17:58,092 --> 00:18:00,320
until we get control
of the situation.

276
00:18:00,392 --> 00:18:03,153
Got a whole lot of wild
rumors running around here.

277
00:18:03,224 --> 00:18:05,417
I'll get that info to the police.

278
00:18:05,491 --> 00:18:06,616
Where are you?

279
00:18:06,692 --> 00:18:08,385
I need to take my mother
to the hospital, Sir.

280
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,014
Well, I'm headed
over there right now

281
00:18:10,091 --> 00:18:11,613
to see if I can find
some missing doctors.

282
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:13,384
You get back to
that roadblock ASAP.

283
00:18:13,457 --> 00:18:15,650
Yes, sir. Over and out.

284
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,018
Why isn't your gun loaded?

285
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,152
It's complicated.

286
00:18:27,056 --> 00:18:27,987
Cool.

287
00:18:28,056 --> 00:18:31,147
I'm a vegetarian, by the way.

288
00:18:31,222 --> 00:18:33,653
Maybe we should just
keep that between us.

289
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,512
Was Kyle stoned?

290
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,879
He wasn't there.

291
00:18:54,953 --> 00:18:56,816
Did his parents
know where he was?

292
00:18:56,887 --> 00:18:57,818
No.

293
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,443
Oh, oh. I'm bleeding.

294
00:19:00,453 --> 00:19:02,316
There's gauze in the kit.

295
00:19:02,386 --> 00:19:03,874
All right. Here, here, I got it.

296
00:19:03,952 --> 00:19:04,883
Here, tilt your head back.

297
00:19:04,952 --> 00:19:07,144
Careful. You got it?

298
00:19:09,185 --> 00:19:11,447
So when are you
going back to Denver?

299
00:19:20,717 --> 00:19:22,377
Park it and meet us inside.

300
00:19:22,451 --> 00:19:23,780
Yes, Ma'am.

301
00:19:47,181 --> 00:19:48,169
Slow down!

302
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,837
Jerk!

303
00:19:51,914 --> 00:19:54,846
Excuse me, ma'am,
my mom needs a doctor.

304
00:19:54,914 --> 00:19:56,709
Yeah, her and everyone else.

305
00:19:56,781 --> 00:19:58,110
Look, here.

306
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,805
Just write her name on the list,
and we'll get to her.

307
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,337
I-I can't wait.

308
00:20:03,414 --> 00:20:05,311
Listen, lady, half the town's sick.

309
00:20:05,379 --> 00:20:06,902
We're overwhelmed
and understaffed.

310
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,070
Just write her name
down on the list.

311
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:16,270
Mom...look, they're
a bit overwhelmed, okay?

312
00:20:16,345 --> 00:20:17,777
We're going to have to wait.

313
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:21,603
What?

314
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:22,803
Do you mind?

315
00:20:26,878 --> 00:20:28,366
I found my mom and dad.

316
00:20:28,444 --> 00:20:29,808
They're in a room,
waiting for the doctor.

317
00:20:29,877 --> 00:20:31,468
You want to come with?
Yeah. I'll be right back.

318
00:20:31,544 --> 00:20:33,702
Trevor, wait!

319
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,299
Stay here.

320
00:20:39,376 --> 00:20:42,103
Salazar, you're supposed
to be on guard duty.

321
00:20:42,176 --> 00:20:43,301
Williams and Elders have it covered.

322
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:44,534
Captain had me come with him.

323
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:46,098
You know the phone lines are down.

324
00:20:46,176 --> 00:20:47,232
The cell phones aren't even working.

325
00:20:47,308 --> 00:20:49,331
I heard it was orders from Washington.

326
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,966
You think this is still just an exercise?

327
00:20:53,042 --> 00:20:57,235
Nah. There's some real serious shit
going down.

328
00:20:57,307 --> 00:20:58,671
Corporal Cross.

329
00:21:05,674 --> 00:21:07,299
Sir.

330
00:21:09,007 --> 00:21:10,802
There's a doctor here from the CDC.

331
00:21:10,874 --> 00:21:13,567
He wants to ask you about
the bodies at Cypress Pond.

332
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:16,366
He was annoyingly insistent.

333
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:26,797
Sarah's great, huh?

334
00:21:26,872 --> 00:21:29,895
I wish she were around more.

335
00:21:29,972 --> 00:21:33,404
Um, does she have a boyfriend?

336
00:21:33,471 --> 00:21:34,697
She's hot, huh?

337
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:39,535
Oh, she's so hot.

338
00:21:41,303 --> 00:21:43,496
You think she'd ever
go out with a private?

339
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,365
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I'm a little bit...

340
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,733
Are you all right?

341
00:21:49,803 --> 00:21:51,826
Oh, my God.

342
00:21:51,902 --> 00:21:53,596
You're freezing.

343
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,192
I need some help over here!

344
00:21:55,269 --> 00:21:56,360
Come on, man.

345
00:21:56,435 --> 00:21:58,264
Stay with me.
Talk to me, talk to me.

346
00:21:58,335 --> 00:21:59,892
Talk to me,
talk to me, talk to me.

347
00:22:02,702 --> 00:22:04,031
Okay, um, Mrs. Cross,

348
00:22:04,101 --> 00:22:06,033
I'm going to go get Sarah.

349
00:22:06,101 --> 00:22:07,328
Okay?

350
00:22:09,135 --> 00:22:10,122
Corporal Cross!

351
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,597
It has to be airborne.

352
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:16,690
But once in the blood,

353
00:22:16,767 --> 00:22:18,097
it mutates faster
than anything else...

354
00:22:18,167 --> 00:22:20,223
Dr. Logan,
this is Corporal Cross.

355
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,924
Thanks for coming.

356
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:25,124
Can you give us a minute?

357
00:22:26,999 --> 00:22:31,059
I find people speak more freely
without a superior officer around.

358
00:22:35,232 --> 00:22:37,720
I'll be outside.

359
00:22:39,631 --> 00:22:41,620
You've had quite a night.

360
00:22:41,698 --> 00:22:43,721
You could say that.

361
00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:45,286
About the bodies,

362
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,125
you said they looked
like they were mauled.

363
00:22:47,197 --> 00:22:48,389
Could it have been
an animal attack?

364
00:22:48,463 --> 00:22:51,429
If an animal can hide
a body in a closet.

365
00:22:51,497 --> 00:22:52,428
The son is missing?

366
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:54,019
Yes.

367
00:22:54,096 --> 00:22:56,392
Did the wounds
look like bite marks?

368
00:22:56,463 --> 00:22:57,394
What?

369
00:22:57,463 --> 00:22:59,928
It's a simple question.

370
00:22:59,996 --> 00:23:01,154
How would I know?

371
00:23:01,229 --> 00:23:02,525
Maybe it's the avian flu.

372
00:23:02,596 --> 00:23:03,619
Don't say that.

373
00:23:03,696 --> 00:23:06,025
Dad, seriously,
that's so not possible.

374
00:23:06,095 --> 00:23:09,220
I heard about this case
in France where...

375
00:23:10,862 --> 00:23:11,953
Dad?

376
00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:14,221
Daddy, what's wrong?

377
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:17,218
Dad?

378
00:23:20,028 --> 00:23:21,526
Daddy?

379
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,349
What's going on?

380
00:23:26,726 --> 00:23:27,919
Daddy?

381
00:23:28,393 --> 00:23:30,084
Dad!

382
00:23:34,092 --> 00:23:35,288
Dad?

383
00:23:37,192 --> 00:23:38,748
Okay, we... we really
need a doctor.

384
00:23:52,991 --> 00:23:55,354
Sir? Sir?

385
00:24:01,657 --> 00:24:03,384
Corporal, you gotta
come to the waiting room.

386
00:24:03,456 --> 00:24:04,547
Something's happening.

387
00:24:04,623 --> 00:24:06,282
To my mom?
To everybody.

388
00:24:06,356 --> 00:24:08,685
What is it?
Something bad. I don't know.

389
00:24:27,887 --> 00:24:30,910
Hey, I thought you guys left hours ago.

390
00:24:33,487 --> 00:24:34,748
What the...

391
00:24:37,487 --> 00:24:39,112
No! No!

392
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:42,478
No! Oh!

393
00:25:09,783 --> 00:25:11,806
Oh, my God! Anybody!

394
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:17,912
So this chick takes
her top off, right?

395
00:25:17,982 --> 00:25:19,448
And I swear to God...

396
00:25:26,115 --> 00:25:28,604
What the...

397
00:25:28,682 --> 00:25:31,113
Now this here's just
a little too much for this cowboy.

398
00:25:31,181 --> 00:25:32,612
Now, you see this button here?

399
00:25:32,681 --> 00:25:34,170
You press it, and you talk into that

400
00:25:34,247 --> 00:25:35,838
if you've got something
to say to the folks

401
00:25:35,914 --> 00:25:40,175
because my shift has now ended,
and I am going to mosey on home.

402
00:25:45,246 --> 00:25:46,234
Or not.

403
00:26:01,012 --> 00:26:03,534
Hey, where the hell are you going?

404
00:26:12,444 --> 00:26:14,875
Hey, I thought you said
there were 2 bodies.

405
00:26:14,944 --> 00:26:16,933
Yeah. Now there's 3.

406
00:26:17,011 --> 00:26:18,772
Show me.

407
00:26:29,209 --> 00:26:30,473
Freeze!

408
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:52,570
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

409
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,164
Hey, maybe you shouldn't
go down there!

410
00:27:09,971 --> 00:27:12,301
What the fuck?

411
00:27:29,936 --> 00:27:32,198
What the fuck?

412
00:27:57,234 --> 00:27:58,324
Come on, come on,
come on.

413
00:28:00,133 --> 00:28:01,497
Go, go, go, go.

414
00:28:03,066 --> 00:28:04,554
God!

415
00:28:09,432 --> 00:28:10,988
Oh, my God!

416
00:28:24,331 --> 00:28:25,819
No, no, no, no!

417
00:28:25,897 --> 00:28:28,090
No! No!

418
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,493
Here they come!

419
00:28:30,864 --> 00:28:33,193
What the fuck was that?

420
00:28:42,162 --> 00:28:43,287
Let me in!

421
00:28:46,829 --> 00:28:48,056
Come on. Come on.

422
00:29:03,427 --> 00:29:04,824
What the hell?

423
00:29:12,193 --> 00:29:14,056
What the hell is happening
to these people?

424
00:29:14,126 --> 00:29:15,217
I don't know.

425
00:29:15,293 --> 00:29:16,690
Where's the basement?

426
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:17,747
Right there.

427
00:29:17,826 --> 00:29:19,382
My mom's in there.

428
00:29:19,459 --> 00:29:20,447
We'll go undercover.

429
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:21,582
That's an order, Corporal!

430
00:29:39,757 --> 00:29:40,882
Come on!

431
00:29:44,823 --> 00:29:45,754
Here.

432
00:29:45,823 --> 00:29:47,312
We're safe!

433
00:30:01,655 --> 00:30:04,143
What the hell was that?
You almost got me killed.

434
00:30:04,221 --> 00:30:06,312
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

435
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:08,081
Bud! Help me.

436
00:30:26,586 --> 00:30:27,574
Oh, my God.

437
00:30:33,585 --> 00:30:35,244
What are we going to do?

438
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,081
Fuck!

439
00:30:53,316 --> 00:30:54,407
Come on.

440
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,673
Look at the radio station.

441
00:31:25,747 --> 00:31:27,712
Look, there's somebody
in there.

442
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,707
Hey, hey, hey...

443
00:31:31,779 --> 00:31:32,938
Hey.

444
00:31:33,512 --> 00:31:35,877
We're gonna make it, okay?

445
00:31:35,945 --> 00:31:37,639
I swear.

446
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:08,201
We can make Molotov cocktails.

447
00:32:08,276 --> 00:32:11,333
Great, and I'll just build a bus
and drive us out of here.

448
00:32:11,409 --> 00:32:12,874
Come on,
we have weapons.

449
00:32:12,942 --> 00:32:14,271
I don't have a gun.
What?

450
00:32:14,342 --> 00:32:16,240
I'm in communications.
We aren't issued weapons.

451
00:32:16,308 --> 00:32:17,797
So basically you're useless.

452
00:32:17,874 --> 00:32:18,840
Shut up, Logan.

453
00:32:18,908 --> 00:32:19,999
Come on. You've got one.

454
00:32:20,075 --> 00:32:21,701
We can shoot enough of them
and get out of here.

455
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:22,738
It's not loaded.

456
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:24,831
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

457
00:32:24,908 --> 00:32:26,771
What the hell kind
of soldier are you?

458
00:32:26,841 --> 00:32:29,363
You don't want to find out
right now, okay?

459
00:32:29,441 --> 00:32:31,202
Bud, where did you park the Humvee?

460
00:32:31,274 --> 00:32:33,041
The lot was full, so I...

461
00:32:33,507 --> 00:32:35,897
Oh, shit. They must have
come out when I was...

462
00:32:35,974 --> 00:32:38,735
Great. A driver without keys
and a soldier without bullets.

463
00:32:38,806 --> 00:32:40,363
It must be my fucking birthday.

464
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,905
What's with you two?

465
00:32:41,973 --> 00:32:43,962
You know what?
It's complicated, okay, pal?

466
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:45,231
How did you get here?

467
00:32:45,305 --> 00:32:46,236
Taxi.

468
00:32:46,305 --> 00:32:47,895
Great. Well, you're nominated

469
00:32:47,972 --> 00:32:49,995
to go out
and hail us another one.

470
00:32:59,471 --> 00:33:01,528
Captain Rhodes' Humvee.

471
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:04,162
He should have the keys on him.
We've got to go get them.

472
00:33:04,237 --> 00:33:05,930
What? No! No. No way!

473
00:33:06,004 --> 00:33:07,230
Those things are everywhere.

474
00:33:10,903 --> 00:33:13,096
Not everywhere.

475
00:33:18,836 --> 00:33:20,062
Come on.

476
00:33:26,069 --> 00:33:28,057
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

477
00:33:28,134 --> 00:33:29,430
Hello.

478
00:33:29,501 --> 00:33:31,490
Hello. Hello, hello!

479
00:33:31,568 --> 00:33:32,499
Somebody.

480
00:33:32,567 --> 00:33:34,090
Hello! Hello?

481
00:33:34,168 --> 00:33:35,724
Stop pounding. Look!

482
00:33:35,801 --> 00:33:37,357
Oh, God! Oh, God!

483
00:33:37,434 --> 00:33:39,764
Oh, God!

484
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:40,958
Oh, God, I'm gonna die!

485
00:33:41,033 --> 00:33:42,363
Open the damn door!

486
00:33:43,666 --> 00:33:46,189
Open the door now!

487
00:33:46,266 --> 00:33:47,357
Open up!

488
00:33:47,433 --> 00:33:48,899
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

489
00:33:48,966 --> 00:33:50,125
Open the door!

490
00:33:50,199 --> 00:33:51,665
Someone help!

491
00:33:51,732 --> 00:33:53,426
Someone open the door!

492
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:55,487
Oh, God! Hurry! Hurry!

493
00:33:58,265 --> 00:34:00,231
Are you one of them?
No!

494
00:34:00,298 --> 00:34:01,559
Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.

495
00:34:01,632 --> 00:34:02,858
You better not be!

496
00:34:10,197 --> 00:34:13,163
Mr. and Mrs. Leitner.
Oh, you're all right.

497
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:16,286
Where's Cody?
Is he okay? Is he...

498
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,862
We wanted to get Cody
to a doctor,

499
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:22,157
but your sister
wouldn't let us,

500
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:23,388
and now he's dead.

501
00:34:23,463 --> 00:34:24,894
Andrew, stop it!

502
00:34:30,829 --> 00:34:33,656
My cough...
I had it before all this.

503
00:34:33,728 --> 00:34:35,489
I'm not sick.

504
00:34:47,894 --> 00:34:48,882
Come on.

505
00:35:06,225 --> 00:35:07,349
Jesus.

506
00:35:16,957 --> 00:35:19,222
Sweet mother of God!
Don't...

507
00:35:20,657 --> 00:35:22,088
Yuck!

508
00:35:23,257 --> 00:35:24,518
God.

509
00:35:43,422 --> 00:35:44,944
Do you want me to go?

510
00:35:45,021 --> 00:35:48,475
Yeah. But I outrank you.

511
00:35:54,054 --> 00:35:55,679
Okay.

512
00:36:13,152 --> 00:36:15,618
Salazar. Are you all right?

513
00:36:15,685 --> 00:36:18,515
Not if you keep karate kicking me.

514
00:36:20,184 --> 00:36:21,673
How did you get away?

515
00:36:21,751 --> 00:36:25,773
When everybody started tripping,
I just jumped in the closet.

516
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,339
Keep laughing, bitch.

517
00:36:28,017 --> 00:36:30,442
All right,
I'm taking Rhodes' Humvee.

518
00:36:30,816 --> 00:36:31,882
Oh, man.

519
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:33,843
You won't be needing this.

520
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:42,176
I got 'em. Let's go.

521
00:36:45,049 --> 00:36:47,081
Correct, my shit.

522
00:36:47,548 --> 00:36:49,014
Go.

523
00:37:10,646 --> 00:37:11,703
No!

524
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:12,973
What?
What happened?

525
00:37:13,046 --> 00:37:14,535
What is it?

526
00:37:15,713 --> 00:37:17,508
Give me some room! Go!

527
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,977
Come on!

528
00:37:19,046 --> 00:37:20,443
He's got me!

529
00:37:23,211 --> 00:37:24,370
Stop!

530
00:37:26,178 --> 00:37:28,541
Pull!

531
00:37:28,611 --> 00:37:30,237
Let's go! Come on!

532
00:37:30,312 --> 00:37:31,402
Go!

533
00:38:22,806 --> 00:38:24,271
Catch! Come on!

534
00:38:25,439 --> 00:38:26,927
Pull!

535
00:38:54,269 --> 00:38:56,735
Tell me you remembered
the keys.

536
00:38:59,801 --> 00:39:01,027
God!

537
00:39:02,402 --> 00:39:03,629
God!

538
00:39:05,668 --> 00:39:06,999
Fuck, he got me.

539
00:39:07,068 --> 00:39:09,326
Oh, fuck, he got me.

540
00:39:09,402 --> 00:39:11,799
Oh, fuck, he got me.
He got me.

541
00:39:11,868 --> 00:39:13,857
I'm sorry.

542
00:39:19,667 --> 00:39:21,432
Oh, fuck!

543
00:39:24,466 --> 00:39:25,489
This is gonna be quick.

544
00:39:25,567 --> 00:39:26,794
No, no!

545
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:29,031
You saw what happened
to Rhodes

546
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:30,525
when he got bit, okay?

547
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,792
This is the only way.

548
00:39:32,066 --> 00:39:33,895
I put bleach on it.

549
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:37,362
Shut up!

550
00:39:37,432 --> 00:39:39,421
Put the gun down.
That's an order.

551
00:39:39,499 --> 00:39:41,691
I don't know if you noticed,

552
00:39:41,765 --> 00:39:43,993
but there's people out there
eating each other, okay?

553
00:39:44,065 --> 00:39:45,928
So fuck you and your orders.

554
00:39:47,398 --> 00:39:49,761
I said shut up!

555
00:39:51,031 --> 00:39:53,462
What are you going to do?
You going to shoot me?

556
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:55,826
Hey, look, Rhodes was bitten
hundreds of times, him once.

557
00:39:55,897 --> 00:39:58,124
Besides, bleach kills
just about everything.

558
00:39:58,196 --> 00:39:59,457
Who the fuck are you?

559
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,859
Look, I'm a doctor, okay?
I know exactly what's...

560
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:04,487
Man, ain't nobody trying
to hear that CSI bullshit.

561
00:40:04,563 --> 00:40:06,461
He gotta go.

562
00:40:08,496 --> 00:40:11,121
Didn't I say shut the fuck up?

563
00:40:15,862 --> 00:40:17,521
Sir.

564
00:40:17,595 --> 00:40:19,822
Look, I will take responsibility for him.

565
00:40:19,894 --> 00:40:23,792
And if the time comes, I'll
do what has to be done, okay?

566
00:40:23,861 --> 00:40:25,486
So just back down!

567
00:40:35,426 --> 00:40:38,517
Look, I ain't got time
for this bullshit.

568
00:40:38,593 --> 00:40:41,115
We need to figure out
how to get the fuck out of here.

569
00:40:41,192 --> 00:40:42,317
I'm watching.

570
00:40:42,393 --> 00:40:44,018
My eye's on you!

571
00:40:54,225 --> 00:40:57,987
Call the police, the National Guard,

572
00:40:58,058 --> 00:41:02,046
and if by any slim chance
the fucking FCC are listening,

573
00:41:02,124 --> 00:41:03,420
they might take notice.

574
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:10,278
I gotta take a break.

575
00:41:10,356 --> 00:41:12,584
This fucking blood
pressure's killing me.

576
00:41:12,656 --> 00:41:15,622
I shouldn't have done
that kumquat diet.

577
00:41:15,689 --> 00:41:18,519
It's probably too late
to stop smoking.

578
00:41:24,055 --> 00:41:25,452
I'm the one who should be worried.

579
00:41:25,521 --> 00:41:27,453
Your wife's been hacking up
a storm since you got here.

580
00:41:27,521 --> 00:41:28,612
What are you trying to say?

581
00:41:28,688 --> 00:41:29,813
Can I give this a try?

582
00:41:29,888 --> 00:41:31,114
Hey, you got a license?

583
00:41:31,187 --> 00:41:32,380
No.

584
00:41:32,454 --> 00:41:33,442
Me, neither.

585
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,383
I ain't got a fucking license.

586
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:46,685
If anyone's there...

587
00:41:46,753 --> 00:41:47,946
You go, kid.

588
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,485
If anyone can hear this,
we are trapped at the radio station

589
00:41:50,553 --> 00:41:54,178
KXWT on Elm Street
in Leadville, Colorado.

590
00:41:54,252 --> 00:41:58,116
Uh, uh, we are under attack.
Repeat. We are under attack.

591
00:41:58,185 --> 00:42:00,082
If anyone is there at all...

592
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:04,042
we need help. Okay?
Something's happening.

593
00:42:04,118 --> 00:42:05,947
People are going out of their minds.

594
00:42:06,018 --> 00:42:07,916
Please, please, please, send help.

595
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:09,075
There's 5 of us here.

596
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:11,082
It's me, my girlfriend Nina,

597
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,741
Mr. and Mrs. Leitner, and the DJ.

598
00:42:12,816 --> 00:42:14,975
Just somebody
send something, okay?

599
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:18,345
We're at the radio station
KXWT on Elm Street.

600
00:42:18,416 --> 00:42:23,178
Oh, oh, and if you hear my voice,
do not go to the Pine Valley Hospital.

601
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,476
Okay? It's not safe there.

602
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:27,107
Repeat. Do not go to the hospital.

603
00:42:32,248 --> 00:42:34,180
We should go now.

604
00:42:36,148 --> 00:42:37,670
Okay.

605
00:42:37,748 --> 00:42:39,236
Take this and give me
one of your guns.

606
00:42:39,314 --> 00:42:41,507
What, you little
Miss MacGyver now?

607
00:42:41,581 --> 00:42:43,342
That shit ain't gonna work.

608
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,712
Give me one of your guns.

609
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,871
If something happens to you,

610
00:42:48,947 --> 00:42:50,207
we can't risk
losing both of them.

611
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:56,912
I know how to shoot
one of those.

612
00:42:56,979 --> 00:42:58,968
I bet you do.

613
00:43:00,013 --> 00:43:01,501
Sweet spear.

614
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:04,902
You see a black man
with a sharp stick

615
00:43:04,978 --> 00:43:06,001
and it's supposed
to be a spear?

616
00:43:06,078 --> 00:43:07,566
Oh, no,
that's not what I...

617
00:43:07,645 --> 00:43:10,475
Bud, can you throw this
chair through the window?

618
00:43:10,545 --> 00:43:11,977
Yeah.

619
00:43:14,144 --> 00:43:15,633
Do you have your lighter?
Yeah.

620
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:17,006
Let's do this.
Are you ready?

621
00:43:17,077 --> 00:43:19,270
Yeah.

622
00:43:19,343 --> 00:43:21,639
Okay...Now!

623
00:43:40,441 --> 00:43:42,202
You gotta shoot them
in the head.

624
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:47,538
Oh, my God!

625
00:43:52,507 --> 00:43:53,495
Jesus!

626
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,431
Oh, my God.

627
00:44:00,907 --> 00:44:02,270
Let's go, Doc!

628
00:44:07,506 --> 00:44:08,562
Watch out!

629
00:44:16,205 --> 00:44:17,761
Shit!

630
00:44:20,205 --> 00:44:22,432
Watch out!

631
00:44:28,637 --> 00:44:31,501
Oh, shit.

632
00:44:34,969 --> 00:44:36,299
Let's go.

633
00:45:21,332 --> 00:45:23,059
Please help me.

634
00:45:23,132 --> 00:45:24,791
I'll help you.

635
00:45:35,063 --> 00:45:36,529
Come on, y'all!

636
00:45:38,397 --> 00:45:39,385
I got him!

637
00:45:41,696 --> 00:45:42,627
I'm out.

638
00:45:42,696 --> 00:45:44,821
Me, too. Shit.

639
00:45:44,897 --> 00:45:46,863
Where's Logan?

640
00:45:54,996 --> 00:45:57,587
What a dick.

641
00:46:00,262 --> 00:46:02,125
There's more of
these motherfuckers?

642
00:46:02,195 --> 00:46:03,626
Light 'em.

643
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:07,326
Come on.

644
00:46:07,394 --> 00:46:09,451
Okay.

645
00:46:16,393 --> 00:46:18,518
Oh, shit!

646
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:35,980
That worked.

647
00:46:36,058 --> 00:46:37,250
Yeah.

648
00:46:48,657 --> 00:46:49,781
Behind you!

649
00:46:55,289 --> 00:46:56,380
Nice shot.

650
00:46:56,456 --> 00:46:58,319
It was kinda gangsta, huh?

651
00:47:03,356 --> 00:47:04,787
We gotta get some more ammo.

652
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:06,753
Hang on.

653
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:26,981
This is bullshit.

654
00:48:18,615 --> 00:48:20,910
Hey, yo, Gomer.

655
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,947
Don't give up, man.

656
00:48:25,514 --> 00:48:27,242
Yeah, I won't.

657
00:48:30,313 --> 00:48:31,779
Shit!

658
00:48:38,779 --> 00:48:41,336
What you dodging them for?
Run their ass over.

659
00:48:41,412 --> 00:48:42,343
They're still somebody.

660
00:48:42,412 --> 00:48:44,310
Not anymore.

661
00:49:24,475 --> 00:49:25,701
That was kinda fun.

662
00:49:28,242 --> 00:49:29,798
That is unbelievable.

663
00:49:29,875 --> 00:49:31,306
We have
to get out of here.

664
00:49:31,374 --> 00:49:32,567
Do you have a car?

665
00:49:32,641 --> 00:49:33,936
No, I ain't going out there.

666
00:49:34,007 --> 00:49:36,269
Hey, dude, if you're feeling lucky,
you go for it.

667
00:49:36,341 --> 00:49:38,170
I'd be like prime rib
to those fuckers.

668
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:40,104
I'm sitting my fat ass right here
till the help comes.

669
00:49:40,173 --> 00:49:42,002
Let's just wait.
Somebody will come.

670
00:49:42,073 --> 00:49:43,733
They have to.

671
00:50:00,638 --> 00:50:03,035
So which one of you
had the nosebleed?

672
00:50:03,104 --> 00:50:04,797
What?
You heard her.

673
00:50:04,871 --> 00:50:05,996
Anybody have a nosebleed?

674
00:50:06,071 --> 00:50:09,366
Just sit down and
answer the question.

675
00:50:09,437 --> 00:50:10,733
What is wrong with you?

676
00:50:10,804 --> 00:50:13,099
Nina, put that down.
What are you doing?

677
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:14,636
Everyone who changed
had a nosebleed.

678
00:50:14,704 --> 00:50:15,670
Who's lying?

679
00:50:15,736 --> 00:50:16,895
Had to be one of them.

680
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:19,232
I said sit down.

681
00:50:19,303 --> 00:50:22,097
Hey, you don't wanna eat this.
Major indigestion.

682
00:50:22,169 --> 00:50:24,192
She hasn't had a nosebleed,
and neither have I.

683
00:50:24,269 --> 00:50:25,565
Look at them.
They're covered in blood.

684
00:50:25,636 --> 00:50:27,033
Shut up!

685
00:50:27,102 --> 00:50:28,090
My son attacked a nurse.

686
00:50:28,169 --> 00:50:29,566
It's her blood!

687
00:50:29,635 --> 00:50:30,726
Hey, check them
for bite marks.

688
00:50:30,802 --> 00:50:31,768
No one's touching my wife.

689
00:50:31,835 --> 00:50:32,801
Just answer
the fucking question!

690
00:50:32,869 --> 00:50:34,993
Don't you get it?

691
00:50:35,068 --> 00:50:37,125
Someone in here is infected.

692
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:40,099
We're all in danger.

693
00:50:53,033 --> 00:50:54,123
All right. Let's make this quick.

694
00:50:54,199 --> 00:50:56,960
What about
your boy back here?

695
00:50:57,032 --> 00:51:00,464
Bud, I'm sorry.

696
00:51:00,532 --> 00:51:03,089
No, no. I understand.

697
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:09,827
You all right?

698
00:51:09,898 --> 00:51:11,659
Yeah.

699
00:51:11,731 --> 00:51:12,719
Do me a favor.

700
00:51:12,798 --> 00:51:14,388
Yeah. Anything.

701
00:51:14,464 --> 00:51:20,192
Grab me a gun, too,
and, um, load mine.

702
00:51:34,796 --> 00:51:37,989
Yeah, that's the type of
shit I'm talking about.

703
00:51:42,059 --> 00:51:43,258
Yeah.

704
00:52:03,926 --> 00:52:06,084
Fucking tell us.

705
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:07,182
Yeah. Now, just...

706
00:52:13,525 --> 00:52:14,957
Oh, God.

707
00:52:15,025 --> 00:52:16,854
You scared me.

708
00:52:16,924 --> 00:52:18,787
Paul?

709
00:52:20,524 --> 00:52:22,150
Get off the couch!

710
00:52:36,156 --> 00:52:37,087
Okay.

711
00:52:37,156 --> 00:52:38,179
Is anyone alive out there?

712
00:52:38,256 --> 00:52:40,188
Can anyone hear me?
Anyone? Anyone?

713
00:52:40,256 --> 00:52:42,551
The police? Someone?
We just need someone.

714
00:52:42,622 --> 00:52:43,815
Something's fucking happened.

715
00:52:43,889 --> 00:52:45,855
We need someone. Please, anyone.

716
00:52:48,188 --> 00:52:50,017
Don't think they know
who they fucking with.

717
00:52:50,088 --> 00:52:51,815
Automatics have no firepower.

718
00:52:51,888 --> 00:52:55,342
Oh, yeah? Says who?

719
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:03,045
This shit right here
was made for me.

720
00:53:04,553 --> 00:53:07,212
By the power of Grayskull.

721
00:53:08,286 --> 00:53:09,343
Okay.
Yeah.

722
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:10,351
Stop fucking around

723
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,351
and start loading
the stuff up.

724
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:13,181
How long you gonna
keep cussing at me?

725
00:53:13,253 --> 00:53:15,616
You see this? This is a machete.

726
00:53:16,086 --> 00:53:19,742
Unappreciative ass.
See if I save your ass again.

727
00:53:27,218 --> 00:53:28,445
Oh, shit.

728
00:53:28,518 --> 00:53:31,075
No! He's restrained.

729
00:53:31,151 --> 00:53:32,174
What if he gets loose?

730
00:53:34,184 --> 00:53:36,116
Then I'll shoot him.

731
00:53:36,183 --> 00:53:37,615
Look, I'm not riding
with this motherfucker.

732
00:53:37,684 --> 00:53:40,479
Yes!
Shut the fuck up!

733
00:53:42,116 --> 00:53:43,377
My, God, he listened.

734
00:54:05,646 --> 00:54:06,879
Sales of new homes rose...

735
00:54:06,948 --> 00:54:09,038
Plus, with pop...

736
00:54:09,113 --> 00:54:11,272
Ever since day one...

737
00:54:11,347 --> 00:54:12,370
I don't understand.

738
00:54:12,447 --> 00:54:14,435
They're not saying
anything about this.

739
00:54:14,513 --> 00:54:15,843
Word hasn't gotten out yet.

740
00:54:15,913 --> 00:54:17,139
...the Army, the National Guard,

741
00:54:17,213 --> 00:54:18,736
anyone with weapons...

742
00:54:18,813 --> 00:54:19,744
Oh, my God.

743
00:54:19,813 --> 00:54:21,005
Is anyone still alive?

744
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:25,111
What the hell are you doing?

745
00:54:26,445 --> 00:54:28,274
Out of town is the other way.

746
00:54:31,045 --> 00:54:32,443
That's my brother.

747
00:54:32,512 --> 00:54:33,909
Your brother's a DJ?

748
00:54:36,011 --> 00:54:37,772
Just send someone.
We're being attacked.

749
00:54:37,845 --> 00:54:40,072
We need help.
We need help now.

750
00:54:40,144 --> 00:54:42,701
Damn it, where the fuck
is the cavalry?

751
00:54:42,777 --> 00:54:44,606
What are you doing?

752
00:54:48,443 --> 00:54:49,932
Oh, my God. Mom!

753
00:54:50,009 --> 00:54:51,907
Trevor!
I have to let her in!

754
00:54:51,976 --> 00:54:53,203
Trevor, wait!

755
00:55:07,108 --> 00:55:08,573
Oh, shit!

756
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,940
That's what I'm talking about!

757
00:55:13,007 --> 00:55:15,235
Run their ass over!

758
00:55:18,474 --> 00:55:20,133
Now you're driving.

759
00:55:22,906 --> 00:55:24,463
Wait! Wait!

760
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:26,130
She could be infected!
No!

761
00:55:27,339 --> 00:55:29,328
Why'd you lie
about the nosebleed?

762
00:55:29,406 --> 00:55:31,269
Don't worry. It'll be fine.

763
00:55:31,339 --> 00:55:32,827
I promise.

764
00:55:32,905 --> 00:55:33,836
Mom!

765
00:55:33,905 --> 00:55:35,394
Trevor!

766
00:55:43,104 --> 00:55:44,297
Oh, God.

767
00:55:47,504 --> 00:55:49,027
Trevor.

768
00:55:50,537 --> 00:55:51,867
Trevor, it wasn't her.

769
00:55:51,937 --> 00:55:54,267
Not anymore.

770
00:55:57,003 --> 00:55:58,832
Nina, is there
anybody else up there?

771
00:55:58,903 --> 00:56:00,028
Yes.

772
00:56:00,102 --> 00:56:01,659
Bring them down.
We're getting out of here.

773
00:56:01,736 --> 00:56:02,667
We are?

774
00:56:02,736 --> 00:56:04,395
Go!

775
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:05,628
Okay. Okay. Okay.

776
00:56:07,902 --> 00:56:10,333
Mr. and Mrs. Leitner,
we've been rescued. Come on.

777
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:15,132
It's time to go.

778
00:56:30,266 --> 00:56:33,198
Mr. and Mrs. Leitner?

779
00:56:56,298 --> 00:56:58,264
No!

780
00:57:06,763 --> 00:57:09,593
Trevor, I'm sorry.

781
00:57:12,229 --> 00:57:14,058
Yo, survivors.

782
00:57:14,129 --> 00:57:15,459
Hello!

783
00:57:17,229 --> 00:57:18,160
Come on.

784
00:57:18,229 --> 00:57:21,127
It's soldiers. Come on!

785
00:57:39,927 --> 00:57:42,290
Nina! Hey!

786
00:57:54,659 --> 00:57:56,022
Quick, get over here.

787
00:57:56,091 --> 00:57:57,523
Come on, man.
They're coming, man.

788
00:57:57,592 --> 00:57:58,716
Hurry up. They're coming!

789
00:57:59,790 --> 00:58:02,121
Oh, no! Oh, no!

790
00:58:03,758 --> 00:58:04,746
We need to leave.

791
00:58:25,988 --> 00:58:28,011
Let's go!

792
00:58:43,121 --> 00:58:45,052
This shit is ridiculous.

793
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:48,245
I mean, why Thriller over here
ain't trying to eat us?

794
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,512
He's a vegetarian.

795
00:58:52,719 --> 00:58:55,241
That's the best explanation
you can come up with?

796
00:58:55,319 --> 00:58:57,444
You got a better one?

797
00:58:57,519 --> 00:59:00,076
All I'm saying, as long
as he don't try to mistake me

798
00:59:00,152 --> 00:59:02,709
for a soybean burger,
we gonna be all right.

799
00:59:06,618 --> 00:59:09,345
They seem to retain
some part of themselves

800
00:59:09,418 --> 00:59:11,213
before they were infected.

801
00:59:11,285 --> 00:59:12,443
Must've retained his hormones

802
00:59:12,517 --> 00:59:14,449
because he definitely
remembers who you are.

803
00:59:16,818 --> 00:59:19,749
Guess that also means
he remembers who was boss,

804
00:59:19,817 --> 00:59:21,510
huh, bitch?

805
00:59:21,583 --> 00:59:24,242
Bad soldier.

806
00:59:24,316 --> 00:59:25,680
Ten hut!

807
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:32,508
That's some crazy-ass shit.

808
00:59:46,748 --> 00:59:48,077
Williams, Captain Rhodes is down.

809
00:59:48,147 --> 00:59:49,874
Do you have any idea where...

810
01:00:08,912 --> 01:00:11,071
Check if the SATCOM's working.

811
01:00:23,844 --> 01:00:25,366
Come on. Let's go!

812
01:00:28,777 --> 01:00:30,901
Let's get out of here!

813
01:00:59,073 --> 01:01:00,868
Them fools were shooting at me!

814
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:08,563
What we taking,
a back road out of here?

815
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:09,900
There is no back road.

816
01:01:09,972 --> 01:01:11,801
Sarah, go up
Hidden Lake Road.

817
01:01:11,872 --> 01:01:13,463
We could get to Boulder
on the fire road.

818
01:01:13,539 --> 01:01:16,300
Yeah, you're right.
Good thinking.

819
01:01:18,305 --> 01:01:19,964
Okay, hold on.

820
01:01:50,669 --> 01:01:52,930
Hey.

821
01:01:53,002 --> 01:01:55,195
You okay?

822
01:01:56,601 --> 01:01:58,726
Remember I said
we're gonna make it?

823
01:01:58,802 --> 01:02:01,029
We are.

824
01:02:08,101 --> 01:02:10,089
Never going back, are we?

825
01:02:10,167 --> 01:02:14,031
I don't know, Trevor.

826
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:17,361
You know, why did you
leave in the first place

827
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:18,524
instead of opening
the bike shop?

828
01:02:18,599 --> 01:02:20,087
You think I was gonna
wait around for you

829
01:02:20,166 --> 01:02:21,655
to get your shit together?
Who built the first bike?

830
01:02:21,733 --> 01:02:23,255
That broke
and almost killed me

831
01:02:23,332 --> 01:02:25,355
when we were, like,
50 miles from home?

832
01:02:25,433 --> 01:02:28,228
Could y'all save that shit
for Oprah, please?

833
01:02:30,131 --> 01:02:31,757
What the fuck was that?

834
01:02:39,798 --> 01:02:40,821
Kyle.

835
01:03:06,162 --> 01:03:07,650
Come on, get out!

836
01:03:10,294 --> 01:03:12,987
What's happening, player?

837
01:03:14,227 --> 01:03:15,420
At ease, soldier.

838
01:03:22,894 --> 01:03:25,121
All right.

839
01:03:25,193 --> 01:03:27,022
Kyle.

840
01:03:30,726 --> 01:03:32,658
Is there any reason
why we're keeping this bitch around?

841
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:36,317
Everyone grab as much
firepower as you can.

842
01:03:36,392 --> 01:03:37,880
Look at that shit.

843
01:03:37,958 --> 01:03:39,890
He likes you.

844
01:03:39,958 --> 01:03:41,890
Got a little zombie crush.

845
01:03:41,958 --> 01:03:44,855
We need to find cover,
some place we an defend.

846
01:03:44,924 --> 01:03:46,447
The old Nike site's
about a mile from here.

847
01:03:46,525 --> 01:03:48,854
Yeah, you're right,
we can hole up there,

848
01:03:48,924 --> 01:03:50,287
wait for daylight.
Good call.

849
01:03:50,357 --> 01:03:52,823
All right, we're gonna
keep Bud with us.

850
01:03:52,891 --> 01:03:54,117
Why?

851
01:03:54,190 --> 01:03:55,588
He might be useful
against them.

852
01:03:55,657 --> 01:03:57,747
And he follows orders.
I like that.

853
01:03:57,823 --> 01:03:59,948
But if he tries anything...

854
01:04:00,023 --> 01:04:02,716
Head shot.

855
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:05,381
Yeah, come on,
Mr. Follows Orders.

856
01:04:05,456 --> 01:04:06,682
About face!

857
01:04:10,189 --> 01:04:11,279
Oh, my...

858
01:04:11,355 --> 01:04:13,184
Forward march!

859
01:04:21,121 --> 01:04:22,484
What was that?

860
01:04:22,554 --> 01:04:25,213
I don't know,
but be ready for anything.

861
01:04:25,287 --> 01:04:27,253
Let's move out!

862
01:04:51,885 --> 01:04:54,043
Come on, let's go.

863
01:04:55,251 --> 01:04:57,716
Have a seat.

864
01:05:02,717 --> 01:05:04,013
What the hell
you looking at?

865
01:05:06,717 --> 01:05:08,909
I know you're not
looking at her ass.

866
01:05:08,983 --> 01:05:10,881
I think ol' Gomer
over here wants...

867
01:05:11,949 --> 01:05:14,437
Salazar, leave him alone!

868
01:05:14,516 --> 01:05:15,777
Trevor.

869
01:05:15,849 --> 01:05:16,780
Good idea.

870
01:05:16,848 --> 01:05:18,439
I'll lead with this.

871
01:05:18,516 --> 01:05:20,606
Don't count on me.

872
01:05:20,681 --> 01:05:23,374
Look, you wanna drop
the passive aggressive bullshit

873
01:05:23,448 --> 01:05:25,107
for once, please?

874
01:05:25,181 --> 01:05:27,772
Over some bicycles?
What's with you two?

875
01:05:27,847 --> 01:05:30,006
It's complicated.

876
01:05:31,047 --> 01:05:32,342
He's a kid.

877
01:05:32,414 --> 01:05:34,175
Yeah, but we all have
to grow up sometime.

878
01:05:34,247 --> 01:05:35,679
Now would be nice.

879
01:05:38,679 --> 01:05:40,668
Bud! Bud! Stop it!

880
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:45,268
Bud! Bud, stop it!

881
01:05:56,545 --> 01:05:58,204
Let's go!

882
01:06:00,778 --> 01:06:02,971
Hey! Follow me!

883
01:06:23,308 --> 01:06:24,239
This way!

884
01:06:24,308 --> 01:06:25,433
Let's go!

885
01:06:46,673 --> 01:06:48,502
Hey, guys.

886
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:53,567
Come on! Cover him!

887
01:07:08,805 --> 01:07:09,792
Nice shot.

888
01:07:09,871 --> 01:07:10,894
Thanks.

889
01:07:14,771 --> 01:07:16,794
Hey, come on.

890
01:07:21,903 --> 01:07:24,335
What the hell?

891
01:07:30,536 --> 01:07:32,195
A Puffy video.

892
01:07:44,034 --> 01:07:46,363
Of course.

893
01:07:46,434 --> 01:07:48,593
Yo, we got company.

894
01:07:48,667 --> 01:07:50,030
Trevor, you loaded?

895
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:51,827
Full up.

896
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:54,230
All right, stay here with Nina, okay?
We'll be back.

897
01:08:53,528 --> 01:08:55,959
Wait, please don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

898
01:08:56,027 --> 01:08:57,925
The fuck are you doing here?

899
01:08:57,994 --> 01:09:00,357
I... I was trying to get away.

900
01:09:00,427 --> 01:09:01,915
Those things were after me.

901
01:09:01,993 --> 01:09:03,925
I found this compound.
I just came here for shelter.

902
01:09:03,993 --> 01:09:05,822
So you took off
to save your own ass?

903
01:09:05,893 --> 01:09:07,018
No.

904
01:09:07,093 --> 01:09:08,319
And destroy some kind
of evidence, huh?

905
01:09:10,292 --> 01:09:12,520
Says something
about Project Wildfire.

906
01:09:13,192 --> 01:09:15,321
Your name's on every one of them.

907
01:09:15,592 --> 01:09:16,958
What is Project Wildfire?

908
01:09:17,126 --> 01:09:17,653
I don't know how my name...

909
01:09:17,726 --> 01:09:20,486
Listen to me!
My mom's dead.

910
01:09:20,558 --> 01:09:23,353
My hometown's turned into
a fucking slaughterhouse.

911
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:24,754
You either tell me
what you know,

912
01:09:24,824 --> 01:09:26,881
or so help me, I will
shoot you dead right here.

913
01:09:26,958 --> 01:09:28,981
Look, if you'll just
give me a second to explain...

914
01:09:30,858 --> 01:09:32,118
Don't lie to her.

915
01:09:32,190 --> 01:09:33,178
If you'll let me finish...

916
01:09:33,257 --> 01:09:35,280
Go ahead.

917
01:09:36,490 --> 01:09:39,354
There were a few select scientists
studying certain biochemical agents.

918
01:09:39,423 --> 01:09:40,912
Including you?

919
01:09:41,590 --> 01:09:44,086
Were you studying them
or creating them?

920
01:09:44,455 --> 01:09:47,013
Look, I was in Washington
to give a report.

921
01:09:47,089 --> 01:09:48,816
I couldn't reach anyone here.

922
01:09:49,588 --> 01:09:51,878
Then I heard about the quarantine.

923
01:09:51,956 --> 01:09:54,944
Look, we don't know our
research has anything to do

924
01:09:55,021 --> 01:09:56,146
with this outbreak.

925
01:09:56,222 --> 01:09:57,915
Yes, we do.

926
01:10:05,420 --> 01:10:06,184
The virus...

927
01:10:06,254 --> 01:10:07,220
It was 3 days ago.

928
01:10:07,287 --> 01:10:09,752
has mutated,
and somehow we have all

929
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:12,752
become infected or eaten,

930
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:14,285
and I'm the last.

931
01:10:14,353 --> 01:10:15,841
I think I've killed them all:

932
01:10:15,919 --> 01:10:19,715
Tom, Grace, and everyone.

933
01:10:19,786 --> 01:10:22,445
I, uh...

934
01:10:23,118 --> 01:10:25,314
have sealed myself
inside this bunker.

935
01:10:25,386 --> 01:10:28,647
I've destroyed the samples
and archived my notes.

936
01:10:28,718 --> 01:10:32,172
And I don't know why the infection
is moving so slowly,

937
01:10:32,251 --> 01:10:34,342
but I can feel it.

938
01:10:34,418 --> 01:10:36,849
I can feel the malevolence.

939
01:10:37,516 --> 01:10:41,508
I'll die here like the pharaohs

940
01:10:41,584 --> 01:10:45,516
with my legacy,
a beautiful weapon...

941
01:10:45,584 --> 01:10:48,640
beautiful weapon.

942
01:10:58,882 --> 01:11:01,110
What was this virus
supposed to do?

943
01:11:01,182 --> 01:11:04,347
It was designed to paralyze enemy troops
by shutting down their neural system

944
01:11:04,415 --> 01:11:06,472
for 6 to 7 hours.

945
01:11:06,548 --> 01:11:08,013
We didn't think it would mutate.

946
01:11:08,081 --> 01:11:11,308
Come on, this would have allowed us
to capture people without killing them.

947
01:11:11,414 --> 01:11:12,812
It was intended to save lives.

948
01:11:12,881 --> 01:11:14,676
Yeah, hell of a job, Doc.

949
01:11:16,547 --> 01:11:18,206
He got out.

950
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:20,507
Yeah, the door was open
when Nina and I got here.

951
01:11:22,546 --> 01:11:23,534
Why aren't we all sick?

952
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:25,545
Some people have
a natural immunity

953
01:11:25,613 --> 01:11:26,579
to specific viruses.

954
01:11:26,646 --> 01:11:28,907
Lucky us.

955
01:11:28,979 --> 01:11:30,672
But from what I
understand,

956
01:11:30,746 --> 01:11:32,439
once bitten,
there's no protection.

957
01:11:32,512 --> 01:11:34,341
Whatever, man.
Where's the back door?

958
01:11:34,412 --> 01:11:35,571
There isn't one.

959
01:11:47,044 --> 01:11:48,476
Oh, shit.

960
01:12:00,110 --> 01:12:01,541
Stay here.

961
01:12:05,109 --> 01:12:06,075
You back?

962
01:12:06,142 --> 01:12:08,233
I'm not going to
die down here,

963
01:12:08,309 --> 01:12:12,434
but you,
you knew about this.

964
01:12:12,508 --> 01:12:14,031
No, I didn't know.
I swear.

965
01:12:14,108 --> 01:12:17,268
Nina, Nina, no.
He's not worth it.

966
01:12:23,041 --> 01:12:24,404
He's smarter than the others.

967
01:12:27,574 --> 01:12:29,005
Don't believe this shit.

968
01:12:29,073 --> 01:12:31,766
I'm not going back
into that airshaft.

969
01:12:39,638 --> 01:12:41,298
Shut up, bitch.

970
01:12:43,139 --> 01:12:45,195
Hey, did you guys get him?

971
01:12:45,271 --> 01:12:46,362
He's in the ventilation system.

972
01:12:46,438 --> 01:12:48,131
Yeah, I got his little girlfriend, though.

973
01:12:55,104 --> 01:12:56,593
That's Dr. Engel.

974
01:12:56,671 --> 01:12:58,364
He was the best man
on the team.

975
01:12:58,437 --> 01:13:01,335
If they do retain
something of what they were,

976
01:13:01,404 --> 01:13:04,199
we are so screwed.

977
01:13:04,269 --> 01:13:05,826
We have to find a way out.

978
01:13:05,903 --> 01:13:06,959
That's the only way out.

979
01:13:07,036 --> 01:13:08,297
That's why
we chose this place.

980
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:10,359
Man, I thought scientists
were supposed to be smart.

981
01:13:10,436 --> 01:13:12,867
Here, follow me.

982
01:13:12,936 --> 01:13:13,959
Dumb asshole.

983
01:13:14,036 --> 01:13:15,467
This place
is a Nike site, right?

984
01:13:15,535 --> 01:13:16,762
Yeah.

985
01:13:16,836 --> 01:13:18,734
Well, they weren't making
sneakers up in here.

986
01:13:18,801 --> 01:13:21,199
Nike sites were built
during the Cold War

987
01:13:21,268 --> 01:13:23,200
to house missiles.

988
01:13:23,268 --> 01:13:24,631
What?

989
01:13:24,701 --> 01:13:27,792
What, you were smoking weed
during history class?

990
01:13:27,868 --> 01:13:32,163
Anyways, there were missiles,
and there had to be missile silos.

991
01:13:32,234 --> 01:13:35,961
We find one of those,
and we'll have our escape route.

992
01:13:39,166 --> 01:13:42,462
Hey, what happened
to Fuck-Face?

993
01:13:44,399 --> 01:13:46,025
Oh, Jesus.

994
01:13:50,199 --> 01:13:52,664
We have to find that silo.

995
01:14:12,796 --> 01:14:15,024
It's going to take forever
to search all these hallways.

996
01:14:15,097 --> 01:14:16,995
We've got to split up.

997
01:14:17,063 --> 01:14:19,153
We meet back here in 5 minutes.

998
01:14:19,229 --> 01:14:22,093
Why do white people
always want to split up?

999
01:14:22,162 --> 01:14:23,389
I'm not doing it.

1000
01:14:23,463 --> 01:14:25,655
He's right.

1001
01:14:25,729 --> 01:14:27,388
Whatever. It's y'all's funeral.
Who is going with who?

1002
01:14:27,462 --> 01:14:28,393
Trevor, you're gonna
go with me.

1003
01:14:28,462 --> 01:14:31,791
No. Trevor and I stick together.

1004
01:14:31,861 --> 01:14:34,020
We'll be okay.

1005
01:14:34,095 --> 01:14:35,822
All right. 5 minutes.

1006
01:14:35,894 --> 01:14:37,019
Not a second longer.

1007
01:14:37,095 --> 01:14:39,026
Be careful.

1008
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:49,191
You look hot.

1009
01:14:50,626 --> 01:14:53,387
Shut the fuck up.

1010
01:15:01,192 --> 01:15:04,715
Lucky somebody paid attention
during history class.

1011
01:15:04,791 --> 01:15:07,484
Yeah, you're not
as dumb as you look.

1012
01:15:07,558 --> 01:15:09,114
Oh, yeah?

1013
01:15:09,191 --> 01:15:11,986
Well, you're not
as annoying as you look.

1014
01:15:19,657 --> 01:15:21,849
Just in case.

1015
01:15:52,253 --> 01:15:55,151
Go!

1016
01:15:55,220 --> 01:15:57,981
Sarah, run!

1017
01:16:19,051 --> 01:16:20,175
Are you all right?

1018
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:22,943
Yeah. Salazar?

1019
01:16:24,651 --> 01:16:26,173
Great.

1020
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:29,809
Holy shit.
What?

1021
01:16:29,883 --> 01:16:31,849
It's missile propulsion tanks.

1022
01:16:31,917 --> 01:16:32,939
Are you sure?

1023
01:16:33,016 --> 01:16:34,277
Yeah.

1024
01:16:34,350 --> 01:16:36,713
We can rig these
like giant flamethrowers,

1025
01:16:36,782 --> 01:16:40,112
get all those things in one place,
and just blast the shit out of them.

1026
01:16:40,482 --> 01:16:41,580
All right.

1027
01:16:41,649 --> 01:16:45,103
As soon as Nina knocks
the nozzles off the tanks,

1028
01:16:45,482 --> 01:16:48,636
all I have to do is...

1029
01:16:52,181 --> 01:16:54,772
Are you all right?

1030
01:16:54,847 --> 01:16:55,835
It's fine.

1031
01:17:04,013 --> 01:17:06,275
All right, I'm going
to be running like hell.

1032
01:17:06,347 --> 01:17:08,642
As soon as I clear,
you fire the tanks, okay?

1033
01:17:08,713 --> 01:17:09,838
Got it.

1034
01:17:09,913 --> 01:17:11,173
And don't worry,
it's going to work.

1035
01:17:11,245 --> 01:17:14,040
I know.

1036
01:17:14,112 --> 01:17:15,043
Hey, Sarah?

1037
01:17:15,112 --> 01:17:16,805
Yeah?

1038
01:17:16,878 --> 01:17:18,139
Don't get eaten.

1039
01:18:05,341 --> 01:18:06,966
Hey!

1040
01:19:27,433 --> 01:19:28,955
Now!

1041
01:20:14,794 --> 01:20:17,926
See if Logan left the keys.

1042
01:20:34,759 --> 01:20:37,324
An update on the outbreak
in Leadville, Colorado.

1043
01:20:37,392 --> 01:20:38,914
We're getting sketchy reports

1044
01:20:38,992 --> 01:20:40,958
that bodies are still being discovered,

1045
01:20:41,025 --> 01:20:43,991
but a spokesman
for the military has assured us

1046
01:20:44,059 --> 01:20:46,820
that the flu-like virus
has been fully contained.

1047
01:20:46,892 --> 01:20:48,755
So while travel to and from the area

1048
01:20:48,825 --> 01:20:51,188
won't be fully restored
for several days,

1049
01:20:51,258 --> 01:20:53,815
it looks like the danger is over.
