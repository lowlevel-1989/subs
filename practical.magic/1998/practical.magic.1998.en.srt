
1
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
For more than 200 years...

2
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,600
... we Owens women
have been blamed...

3
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,700
...for everything that has
ever gone wrong in this town.

4
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,800
Is that why people hate us
so much, Aunt Frances?

5
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,900
They don 't hate us, sweetheart.
We just make them a little nervous.

6
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,100
Let's face it, Jet. We Owens women
have always created a stir.

7
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,300
It all began with
your ancestor, Maria.

8
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,500
She was a witch.
The first in our family.

9
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,600
And you, my darlings,
are the most recent...

10
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,700
...in a long and distinguished line.

11
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,800
Is that why they wanted to hang her?
Because she was a witch?

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The fact that our Aunt Maria was
a bit of a heartbreaker didn 't help.

13
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,200
Nor did it help that
most of her lovers...

14
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,200
...had wives on the hanging committee.

15
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,400
But no, I don 't think it was
either of those reasons.

16
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,600
They feared her
because she had a gift.

17
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,800
A power that has been passed
on to you children.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
She had the gift...

19
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,100
...of magic.

20
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,700
And it was this very gift...

21
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,800
... that saved her life.

22
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,400
She was banished
to this very island.

23
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,600
With her unborn child
growing inside her belly...

24
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,700
...she waited for her lover
to rescue her.

25
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,000
But he never came.

26
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,100
No one came.

27
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,200
In a moment of despair...

28
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,300
...she cast a spell upon herself:

29
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,300
She would never again...

30
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,500
...feel the agony of love.

31
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,500
But as her bitterness grew...

32
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,700
... the spell turned into a curse.

33
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,800
A curse on any man
who dared love an Owens woman.

34
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,200
Is that why Daddy died?

35
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,300
From the curse?

36
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,300
Yes, my darling.

37
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Your mother knew.

38
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,500
She heard the beetle ticking
for your father's death all day long.

39
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,800
She knew that when you hear
the sound of the deathwatch beetle...

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
... the man you love
is doomed to die.

41
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,200
But that's how you came
to live with us.

42
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,300
We tucked you into our lives then.

43
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,500
We've raised you
the best way we know how.

44
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,600
In this house, we have
chocolate cake for breakfast.

45
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,800
We never bother with silly things
like bedtimes or brushing our teeth.

46
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,900
But with the sweets...

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
...comes the sour.

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So when you find yourself
the center of attention....

49
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,300
You want to play?

50
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,300
It's not that they hate you.
It's that, well. ...

51
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,500
We're different.

52
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,500
You witch!

53
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,600
Witch! Witch!
You're a bitch!

54
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,200
Gillian.

55
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,300
Sally.

56
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,400
The only curse in this family. . .

57
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,400
. . .is sitting right there
at the end of the table.

58
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Your Aunt Fanny.

59
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,700
Come on, Jetty,
even you have to admit. . .

60
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,700
. . .any man who gets involved
with an Owens woman. . .

61
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,900
. . .is bound to end up
6 feet under.

62
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,000
Spare me.

63
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,000
What about my poor Ethan?

64
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,100
An accident.

65
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,200
It was fate.

66
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,200
It was an accident.

67
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,200
It was fate.

68
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,300
-Accident!
-Fate!

69
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,300
Mommy died of a broken heart,
didn't she?

70
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,500
Yes, my darling girl, she did.

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
My little witch. . .

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,100
. . .Iet's go inside
and do some spells.

73
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,100
-What about my homework?
-Pish!

74
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,200
Tosh! You'll both learn things
in this house. . .

75
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,400
. . .you'll never learn in school.

76
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,500
Let's go.

77
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Come on, Gilly!

78
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,700
I'm coming, Sally!

79
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,900
Very good, Sally!

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You've been blessed with a gift.

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What about me?

82
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,200
We don't worry about you, Gilly-Bean.

83
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,300
Your talents will emerge in time.

84
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,600
Sally, you just stay right there.
Keep working on your spells.

85
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,800
Just keep working on your spells.

86
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Get the bird.

87
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,100
Get the book.

88
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,100
I want him so much,
I can't think about anything else.

89
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,400
I don't sleep.

90
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,400
He has to leave his wife.
He has to leave her now.

91
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,600
Perhaps you might find
one better suited.

92
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,600
I don't want anyone else.
He's all I think about.

93
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,900
Why else would I come here?

94
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,900
Take the money, Jet.

95
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,400
I want him to want me so much
he can't stand it.

96
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,900
Be careful what you wish for.

97
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,200
I hope I never fall in love.
I hope I never fall in love.

98
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,300
I hope I never fall in love.
I hope I never fall in love.

99
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,400
I can't wait to fall in love.

100
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,600
He will hear my call a mile away.

101
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,800
He will whistle my favorite song.

102
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,900
He can ride a pony backwards.

103
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,000
What are you doing?

104
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Summoning up a true love spell. . .

105
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,200
. . .called Amas Veritas.

106
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,100
He can flip pancakes in the air.

107
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,300
He'll be marvelously kind.

108
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,500
And his favorite shape. . .

109
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,700
. . .will be a star.

110
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And he'll have. . .

111
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,100
. . .one green eye. . .

112
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,400
. . .and one blue.

113
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,700
Thought you never wanted
to fall in love.

114
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,900
That's the point.

115
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,900
The guy I dreamed of doesn't exist.

116
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And if he doesn't exist,
I'll never die of a broken heart.

117
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,400
And if he doesn 't exist...

118
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,300
...l'll never die of a broken heart.

119
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,700
Get the door!

120
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,100
Sal, you have. . .

121
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,200
. . .no idea!

122
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,300
Do you love him enough
to marry him?

123
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,300
Come on, Sal, what's enough?

124
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,500
I hate it here.

125
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,500
I want to go where no one's
even heard of us.

126
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,600
I feel like I'll never
see you again.

127
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,700
Of course you will.

128
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,800
We'll grow old together.

129
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,900
It'll be you and me
living in a big house.

130
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
These two old biddies
with all these cats.

131
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,000
I bet we even die on the same day.

132
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,300
You swear?

133
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,300
Honey. . .

134
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,300
. . .I need your pocketknife.

135
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,700
Here.

136
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,800
My blood.

137
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,900
Your blood.

138
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,200
Our blood.

139
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,300
I love you, Gilly-Bean.

140
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,500
I love you too.

141
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,000
-Good morning.
-Hello, boys.

142
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,300
Charlie, looking good!

143
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,300
God, what was I thinking?

144
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,500
Franny, let it go.

145
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,500
My goodness, Gillian's in Orlando!
She's in Orlando.

146
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,600
I guess that
Roto-Rooter man is history.

147
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,700
-According to that, he is.
-It's insane.

148
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,900
She keeps going through
all these guys.

149
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,000
Hopefully, someday she'll find
a guy who'll go through her.

150
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,300
Hello, darling. How are you?

151
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,300
Oh, Jet, just give it up.

152
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,400
Never.

153
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,400
God, I miss her.

154
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Oh, sweetie!

155
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,600
Oh, dear!

156
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,900
Oh, Samson!
Now just knock it off.

157
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,200
All I want is a normal life.

158
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,200
Darling, when will you understand. . .

159
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,300
. . .that being normal
is not necessarily a virtue.

160
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,300
It denotes a lack of courage.

161
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,400
It's what I want.

162
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,600
See this couple? He's having an
affair with the babysitter.

163
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,700
And she can eat a pound cake
in under a minute.

164
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,300
Sorry!

165
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,900
What time is it?

166
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,000
Any moment now.

167
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,900
Where are you going, dear?

168
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,900
Most excellent.

169
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,300
Dear Gillian:

170
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,400
Today is our
third anniversary...

171
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,500
...and all I have to show for it
are two beautiful little girls...

172
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,700
...and a husband
ljust can 't stop kissing.

173
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,800
I don 't even mind the beard.

174
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,900
I wish you could see us.

175
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,100
No more stones being thrown,
no taunts cried out.

176
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,300
Everything is just so blissfully...

177
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,300
...normal.

178
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,500
Life is perfect.

179
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,800
Dear Sal:

180
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,900
I'm lying in the sun.

181
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,100
I'm hanging by the pool.

182
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,100
I've got a million friends.

183
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,200
You might say...

184
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,300
... that life is...

185
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,400
...perfect.

186
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,700
But I don 't care
about any of it.

187
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,900
In fact, I only have
two words to say to you:

188
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,900
Jimmy Angelov.

189
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,200
Jimmy...

190
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,100
...Angelov.

191
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,300
Angel.

192
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,300
Angelov, Angelov.

193
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,200
Where are you?

194
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,200
Don't do this to me.

195
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,500
Come on! Come on!

196
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,500
-Hey, boys, catch anything today?
-Not much.

197
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,600
See you in a bit.

198
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,800
Jimmy, what's going on?

199
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,900
I hear you.

200
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,100
I hear you.

201
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,100
Don't!

202
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,100
How's Mary doing?

203
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,200
She's good?

204
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,600
That can't be. No!

205
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,700
What's that?

206
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,800
I know you're in there.

207
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Michael, look out!

208
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,100
Look out behind you!

209
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,300
On your right!

210
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,000
It was the curse, wasn't it?

211
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,200
He died because
I loved him so much!

212
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,300
My poor little girl.

213
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,600
We had no idea. . .

214
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,700
. . .when we cast the spell. . . .

215
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,900
What spell?
What are you talking about?

216
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,100
You didn't!

217
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,300
Please tell me. . .

218
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,400
. . .that my own flesh and blood--

219
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,300
It was just a little push.

220
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,500
You wanted so much to be happy.

221
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,500
We never expected
that you'd truly love him.

222
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,600
Well, I did.

223
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,800
And I want him back.

224
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
You brought him into my life.
You bring him back!

225
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,100
Bring him back!
I've never asked you for anything!

226
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,200
I never asked for spells, but do
this! You can bring him back.

227
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,400
No, dear.

228
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:51,500
We won't do that.

229
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,500
We don't do that.

230
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,600
You can do this.
I know you can. I remember.

231
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,600
I found it here when Mommy
and Daddy died.

232
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,800
Even if we did bring him back,
it wouldn't be Michael.

233
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,900
It'd be something else.
Something dark. . .

234
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,100
. . .and unnatural.

235
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:10,100
I don't care what he comes back as.
As long as he comes back.

236
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,300
Please do this for me.
Please!

237
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,600
Please!

238
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,100
This is only temporary.
Don't get too comfortable.

239
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,100
No chocolate for breakfast.

240
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,100
Homework will be done
after dinner.

241
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,300
Teeth and hair brushed
before bed.

242
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,400
And as for you two. . .

243
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,600
. . .my children will never do magic.

244
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
Ever.

245
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,400
Mom?

246
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,600
It's time for us to go to school.

247
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,700
Mommy.

248
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,800
It's the same time
as yesterday. . .

249
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,900
. . .and the day before that,
and the day before that.

250
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,100
Out of bed, sleepyhead!

251
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,400
I'm worried about Antonia.

252
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,400
Do you know. . .

253
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,400
. . .she puts on her mouse ears,
she drives around town all liquored up.

254
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,700
Naked!

255
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,000
All right. . .

256
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,100
. . .I'll see you around.

257
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,100
Come here, you!

258
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,300
I'm sorry, baby.
I'm just so. . .

259
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,500
. . .tired.

260
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,500
It's okay, Mommy.

261
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,400
Gilly.

262
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,800
Sally.

263
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,300
I was just thinking about you.

264
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,400
You're always thinking about me.

265
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,200
Honey, I just have to go
to the bathroom.

266
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,500
Let's go together.

267
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,500
Jimmy, come on.

268
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,600
I'm just kidding.

269
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,700
Go.

270
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,200
You're in my blood like holy wine

271
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,400
You taste so bitter and so sweet

272
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,600
I could drink a case of you

273
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,000
Still I'd be on my feet

274
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,300
I was really, really happy.

275
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,900
We were going to open
a botanical shop.

276
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,900
He'd get the ingredients,
and I'd make the stuff.

277
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
He really loved my
mint-oatmeal shaving cream.

278
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,200
He couldn't stop eating it.

279
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,300
I'm sure all this is really
boring to you. . .

280
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,500
. . .but he made me laugh.

281
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,500
What kind of name is Angelov?

282
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,600
Bulgarian.

283
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,700
Bulgarian?

284
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,900
He's from somewhere
near Transylvania.

285
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,100
He has this whole. . .

286
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,200
. . .Dracula-cowboy thing about him.

287
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,400
He's just so intense.
I mean. . .

288
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,500
. . .he talks about our relationship
in terms of centuries.

289
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,700
Sometimes we just stay up all night. . .

290
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,900
. . .worshipping each other. . .

291
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,900
. . .Iike bats.

292
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,100
Thank God for Jet's belladonna. . .

293
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,200
. . .or I'd never get any sleep.

294
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,300
Why are you taking
that stuff?

295
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,400
I'm not using it. I just give
it to him every now and then.

296
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,700
So you're drugging your boyfriend
to get a little shuteye?

297
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,900
Doesn't that seem
strange to you?

298
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Maybe.

299
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,200
And he's strong.

300
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,200
So much stronger than me.

301
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,300
He can survive the curse.

302
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,700
Do you forgive our mother?

303
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Sometimes.

304
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,100
You'll never forgive yourself. . .

305
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,300
. . .unless you get up. . .

306
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,300
. . .and you get dressed. . .

307
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,400
. . .and brush your goddamn teeth,
because your breath stinks. . .

308
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,700
. . .and you take care of
those little girls.

309
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,800
Yeah, you're right.

310
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,400
I love you.

311
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,600
I love you too, Gilly-Bean.

312
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,500
Opening Soon

313
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,900
How's your wicked mommy doing?

314
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,100
Witch! Witch! You're a witch!

315
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,200
You'd think after 300 years,
they'd make up a better rhyme.

316
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,500
Your troublemaker
started this.

317
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,600
-I hate you!
-Put the finger down, Kylie.

318
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,700
I hope you get. . .

319
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,800
. . .chickenpox!

320
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,100
She was just kidding.

321
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,100
No, she wasn't, Mom.

322
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,200
She was not kidding.

323
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,300
What's wrong with you?
We do not cast.

324
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,400
We do not toy with people's lives.
This is not a game.

325
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,500
No, you don't cast! You probably
couldn't even if you tried!

326
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,800
She has all this power
and doesn't use it!

327
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,900
I think you really hurt
Mom's feelings.

328
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,000
Kylie thinks any man who
marries us is going to croak.

329
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,200
That's such hogwash.

330
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,300
What about your grandparents,
Jack and Regina?

331
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,400
Grandma Regina died
of a broken heart, didn't she?

332
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,600
How could she do that?

333
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,800
Leave Mom and Aunt Gilly behind
when they were little?

334
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,900
Why won't she talk about it?

335
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,900
Was Mama good at spells as a girl?
Why won't she do spells now?

336
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,100
What's going on here?

337
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:54,200
Nothing.

338
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,200
Just making toast, is all.

339
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,500
Finish your homework?

340
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,600
A storm's coming.
Go check the windows for me.

341
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Making toast?

342
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,200
I want you to watch
what you say to those girls.

343
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,300
I don't want you filling
their heads with your nonsense.

344
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,500
We'd never tell them nonsense.

345
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,700
Good night, sweetie.

346
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,900
Dearest Gilly:

347
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,100
Sometimes I feel
there's a hole inside of me...

348
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,200
...an emptiness that
at times...

349
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,300
...seems to burn.

350
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:54,400
I think if you lifted my heart
to your ear, you could hear the ocean.

351
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,700
And the moon tonight,
there's a circle around it.

352
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,800
A sign of trouble
not far behind.

353
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I have this dream of being whole.

354
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,100
Of not going to sleep
each night wanting.

355
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:13,200
But still, sometimes when the wind
is warm or the crickets sing...

356
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,400
...l dream of a love that even time
will lie down and be still for.

357
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,700
Ijust want someone
to love me.

358
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,800
I want to be seen.

359
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,100
I don 't know.
Maybe I've had my happiness.

360
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,300
I don 't want to believe it...

361
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,400
...but there is no man, Gilly.

362
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,600
Only that moon.

363
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Gillian!

364
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,200
-It's Gillian.
-I know.

365
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,300
What's wrong?

366
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,300
I'm scared.
Can you come and get me?

367
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,400
Where are you?

368
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,500
I'm taking the first flight out.
Watch the kids.

369
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,600
Just go to Gilly.
The children'll be fine.

370
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,700
We'll take them to
the solstice celebration.

371
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,900
Why can't you two
just stay here?

372
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,900
We can't back out.
We're on the committee.

373
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,100
We're presenting.

374
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,100
I don't want them dancing naked
under the moon.

375
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,200
No, of course not, dear.

376
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,300
Nudity is entirely optional,
as you well remember!

377
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,800
Hello!

378
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,900
Gilly, I'm here.

379
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Thanks, Sal.

380
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,100
Hi.

381
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,100
The room service here sucks.

382
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,300
Let's get you out of here.

383
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,400
I'm fine.

384
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,800
He's been really crazy.

385
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,800
We've been driving
for two weeks straight.

386
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Not even straight.
In these zigzags, back and forth.

387
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,200
Damn these shoes!

388
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,100
Then today he says
he wants a jelly doughnut.

389
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,400
And he says to the kid,
"Jelly doughnut, with cream. "

390
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,500
And the kid looked confused.

391
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,600
And I said,
"Jimmy, jelly's not a cream. "

392
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,700
Then the kid laughed and I laughed
and then he punched me.

393
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,800
He punched me real hard.
The bastard!

394
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Blood on the moon.

395
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,100
-I know.
-Blood on the moon.

396
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,200
I know. Get in the car.

397
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,300
Where's my tiger's eye?
It brings me luck.

398
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,300
-Is it in here?
-I left it.

399
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,400
-I need my tiger's eye!
-It's probably in the bag!

400
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,500
Gillian, come on!

401
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,200
Honey, just forget--

402
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,300
You drive.

403
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,800
You want some?

404
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,900
Nope?

405
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,400
You ever read any books. . .

406
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,400
. . .by Louis L'Amour?

407
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,600
Louis L'Amour. . .

408
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,800
. . .was a foreigner. . .

409
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,900
. . .and he loved all things cowboy.

410
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Just like me, Jimmy-Boy.

411
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,200
Louis would write
stories about rustlers.

412
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,300
Rustlers. . .

413
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,400
. . .who were really bad guys.

414
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,500
The belladonna is in my bag.

415
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,700
They would try to steal the cattle.

416
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,800
But before they could sell them. . .

417
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,900
. . .they would try to take away
the brand of the owner with an acid. . .

418
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,100
. . .or by. . .

419
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,100
. . .scrubbing.

420
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:39,300
Unfortunately, they could
never get rid of it.

421
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,400
So they would be caught
and get hanged.

422
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,500
What are you doing?

423
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,600
Come on.

424
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,600
You can't hide the brand.

425
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,700
It's just you and me.

426
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,900
Watch the road!

427
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,800
Shut up!

428
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Rustlers and branding!
Louis L'Amour! Who is not a foreigner!

429
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,100
He's from North Dakota,
you asshole!

430
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,300
-Watch the road!
-You're freaking me out, Dracula freak!

431
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,400
Give me the bottle
before I plow you into a truck. . .

432
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,400
. . .just to get you to shut up!

433
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,600
Calm down!

434
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,900
You know, girls. . .

435
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
. . .I am feeling very into
sisters right now.

436
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,400
You were always on my mind

437
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,500
You were always on my mind

438
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,900
He should've passed out by now.

439
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
-You didn't give him enough.
-I gave him plenty.

440
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,600
What's he going to do?

441
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,800
Just stay calm.

442
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
If I made you feel

443
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,200
Second best

444
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,200
I'm so sorry

445
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,300
I was blind

446
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,400
You were always on my mind

447
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,600
Jimmy, please, baby.

448
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,700
Come on.

449
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,700
-Come on, baby, I love you.
-I'm so sorry, my love.

450
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,900
I want to be with you forever.

451
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,900
Jimmy, please.

452
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,800
He's out.
He's passed out.

453
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,800
Oh, God!

454
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Oh, my God!

455
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,100
How much did you give him?

456
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:03,000
I wasn't using a measuring cup!
He tried to kill you!

457
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,300
Come on!

458
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,600
Please, God, if you get us out of this,
I'll be good. I'll have babies.

459
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,700
I have babies, Gillian.

460
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,900
I had normal.

461
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,900
I worked really hard
to get that normal.

462
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:25,100
It's all my fault, Sally.
I didn't mean to ruin your life.

463
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,200
I just had no one else
to turn to.

464
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,300
Get in the car.

465
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,400
Get in the car.

466
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,600
We have to go to the police.
It was self-defense.

467
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,900
The old slowly-poison-him-to-death
self-defense?

468
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Come on, Sally,
they're never going to believe us.

469
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,200
You should stop smoking so much.

470
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,300
Why?

471
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,400
I'll probably get life.

472
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,400
I should smoke two at once.
It'll shorten the sentence.

473
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,600
I really don't want
to lose my children.

474
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:06,900
I know.

475
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,900
I don't want you to either.

476
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,700
What are you thinking?

477
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,800
When Michael died, you asked
the aunts to bring him back.

478
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
But they wouldn't.

479
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Wouldn't, but not couldn't.

480
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:40,100
They were right. He'd come back
as something dark and unnatural.

481
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,300
Jimmy already is dark and unnatural.
I don't care what he comes back as.

482
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:47,300
No, that is not an option.
That is not a choice.

483
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,600
We don't have a choice!
This is our choice!

484
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
You. . .

485
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
. . .owe me. . .

486
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,100
. . .bigtime.

487
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,300
He's going to be so pissed.

488
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,700
Okay, here we go.

489
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,200
-Watch his balls.
-You watch them!

490
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,400
Spell book.

491
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,900
Okay, Jimmy,
I will get you out of this. . .

492
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,100
. . .but when I do,
we are definitely breaking up.

493
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,200
It is over.

494
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,400
What are you doing?

495
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,500
Nothing.

496
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,700
Are you sure. . .

497
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,800
. . .you want to do this?

498
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,900
Absolutely.

499
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:26,400
"Lips pursed, emit wind over tongue
in motion, teeth on edge. "

500
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,700
Good enough, good enough.

501
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,900
"Touch bounded smudge of blue sage
with braided wheat straw.

502
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:41,100
Insert needles
through eyes of corpse. "

503
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,300
-Through the eye?
-In the eye.

504
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:50,600
No way!

505
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,600
I think we should wait
for the aunts.

506
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,700
It's not like
he's going to stay fresh.

507
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,800
It's now or never.

508
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,900
I need for you to get me something
white to write on top of the star.

509
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Chop-chop!

510
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,200
This is all I could find.

511
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,300
This is actually brilliant.
This is good.

512
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,400
Now we're supposed to say:

513
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,500
"Black as night. . .

514
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,600
. . .erase death from our sight.

515
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,600
White as light.

516
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,800
Mighty Hectate make it right. "

517
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:22,900
Black as night.

518
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:24,900
White as light.

519
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:28,100
White as light.
Mighty Hectate make it right.

520
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,200
White as light.

521
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,400
Black as night.

522
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,300
Erase death from our sight.

523
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:40,400
White as light.
Mighty Hectate make it right.

524
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,100
I want you to be my wife!

525
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,200
Can you promise me that?

526
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,200
I want you to be my wife!

527
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,500
I want you to be my wife!

528
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,900
You have the worst taste in men.

529
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,400
I know this sounds
really stupid right now. . .

530
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,500
. . .but I just. . . .

531
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,600
I just really wanted to say. . .

532
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,800
. . .thank you.

533
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,900
Thanks for being my sister.

534
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,100
It's all right.

535
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,200
Let's just put this
all behind us now.

536
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,400
What will we tell the aunts?

537
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,500
Nothing.

538
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,100
They're here.

539
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,200
What if they don't like me?

540
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,300
You won't believe it!
We danced naked under the full moon!

541
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,500
It was so fun!

542
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,500
-We did!
-So cool!

543
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:32,700
Oh, my God!

544
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,800
Aunt Gilly's home!

545
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,100
You guys are so big!
I can't believe this!

546
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,500
Hi, Aunt Frances.

547
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,500
My darling little girl.

548
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:56,700
Oh, dear!

549
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:02,800
A little mugwort
will fix that right up.

550
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,100
Kylie. . .

551
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,100
. . .why don't you and I
just go to the greenhouse?

552
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:12,200
I'm so happy to see you, sweetie.

553
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,500
Don't you worry, dear.

554
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,500
Whoever he was,
he'll get what he deserves.

555
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:25,700
I think a brownie for breakfast
would fix you right up.

556
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
A brownie?

557
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,900
You're still doing that?

558
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
You've been away too long.

559
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,200
Some things never change.

560
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,100
Too long you have been away.

561
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,200
Where are they?

562
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,800
I love this stuff.

563
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,900
It's great!
You've done a great job.

564
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:57,100
If you're going to work here,
maybe you could, I don't know. . .

565
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,200
. . .work.

566
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,200
I am. I'm testing
the merchandise.

567
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,400
You know where you can reach me.
I'll be back, if anyone cares.

568
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:15,800
Did I do something wrong?

569
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Phone tree day.

570
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,100
Phone tree day.

571
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,100
Parents' hotline.
If there's an emergency. . .

572
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:25,300
. . .Iike a snow day, they decide
who's the most responsible--

573
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,300
You mean the most popular.

574
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,400
--responsible mother
to sound the alarm.

575
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,500
Each mom calls the next.
It's a big deal to get chosen.

576
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,600
Sally never gets picked.
Everybody knows she's a--

577
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:37,900
Different.

578
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,100
Quiet! Quiet, quiet!

579
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,100
Third name from the top
of the phone tree is. . .

580
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,300
. . .Dori Kancher.

581
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,700
-Sorry to interrupt.
-Can I help you?

582
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,900
My sister.

583
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,900
Just wanted to see my sister.

584
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,200
Is that a snake tattoo?

585
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:16,300
Yeah. There's one
on her boob too.

586
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,500
That's right.

587
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,400
I'm back.

588
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,600
Hang onto your husbands, girls.

589
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,900
All that's missing now is
me naked without my homework.

590
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:31,900
Second from the top of the phone tree
will be Abigail Little.

591
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,100
Is this for real?

592
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,100
She screwed Coach Halfacre.

593
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,400
-Don't do that.
-It wasn't me.

594
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,500
-I certainly didn't do it.
-It was you.

595
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:49,700
Finally, I'm so pleased
to report this.

596
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,800
The top of the phone tree list is. . . .

597
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,100
One moment.

598
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,300
It's Sally Owens.

599
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,500
Go, Sal!

600
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,600
Now that was me.

601
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,300
Eye of newt...

602
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:28,400
... toe of frog...

603
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,400
. . .wool of bat, tongue of dog. . . .

604
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,500
Adder's fork and blindworm's sting.

605
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,600
Barbados lime is just the thing.

606
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,700
Cragged salt like a sailor's stubble!

607
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,800
Flip the switch. . .

608
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
. . .and let the cauldron bubble.

609
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,100
How convivial!

610
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,300
Wakey-wakey!

611
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,700
Midnight margaritas!

612
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,800
Come on!

613
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:20,900
No, this is serious.

614
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
All right.

615
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I see a man. . . .

616
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:28,100
I see a man in
your future and he is. . . .

617
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,200
He is gorgeous.

618
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:35,500
He is big.

619
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,700
But you're scared to death. . .

620
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:43,700
. . .and you wind up
like a frigid old hag. . .

621
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:46,900
. . .with your two frigid
old hag aunts.

622
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,200
I don't know where that came from.
That was weird.

623
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:56,300
She's never been interested
in her gifts.

624
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,400
-She just made that all up.
-Don't lie.

625
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,500
Gillian has her own magic.

626
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,600
And we all know what it is.

627
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:06,900
Oh, please!

628
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,800
Since when is being a slut
a crime in this family?

629
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:16,100
What would you know about it?

630
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,300
When we put that spell on you
for Michael. . .

631
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,400
. . .we had to bind it with molasses. . .

632
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,500
. . .just to get your legs to open up.

633
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:26,700
That's so wrong.

634
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,900
You self-centered shrew!

635
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:33,100
Ingrate!

636
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:34,100
Goody two-shoes!

637
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,100
Witch!

638
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:57,900
Quite as often as I should have

639
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:03,100
Could have said and done

640
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,300
Ijust never found the time

641
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,400
You were always...

642
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,500
...on my mind

643
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,800
Where did this bottle come from?

644
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Where did this bottle come from?

645
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:26,000
Someone left it on the porch

646
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:40,800
What's going on here?

647
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:42,900
What's going on with you?

648
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,000
What's going on in this house?

649
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,000
Something's going on.
I can smell it.

650
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:52,000
It's a very distinct smell.
It's the smell of bullshit.

651
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,200
I don't know what
you're talking about.

652
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,400
Broom fell.

653
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,500
Company's coming.

654
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:05,700
We had a problem.
We handled it.

655
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:07,800
We deserve an explanation.

656
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:15,100
Right.

657
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,200
Come on, Jet, let's go.

658
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,600
No.

659
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,600
It's just not possible.
Don't even think it.

660
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,800
Then tell me how that got here.

661
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:32,800
How did this bottle get here?

662
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
It's not possible.

663
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,600
Leaving like this
is a harsh lesson.

664
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,600
A lesson they must learn
on their own.

665
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,700
What about the little ones?

666
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,800
Not to worry, Jetty.

667
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:59,900
A good piece of Maria's hanging rope
will protect them.

668
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
You must promise us
you won 't take them off.

669
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:07,100
-Not until we come home.
-We'll only be gone a short while.

670
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:09,300
Do you hear us?

671
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,400
Promise?

672
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,500
-Love you.
-Love you too.

673
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:27,000
Make her stop.
I'll pay whatever it takes.

674
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,100
Honey, can I see that a second?

675
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:31,200
Thanks.

676
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:33,400
What's that thing
around your neck?

677
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,400
-The aunts gave it to us.
-They said it'd protect us.

678
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:42,500
Kylie, please get that mint from
the garden before your bus comes.

679
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:44,700
Where is the aspirin?

680
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:51,000
-Please do as I say.
-Not while he's out there.

681
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,200
Not while who's out where?

682
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:57,300
The man under the roses.

683
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,400
What?

684
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,600
I don't see him.
Are you looking at him now?

685
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:07,700
He's right there.

686
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:08,800
Where?

687
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:11,900
By the roses.

688
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
They grew overnight.

689
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,100
Oh, shit!

690
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,200
Okay, sweetie, we'll get rid of it.

691
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,300
You better call the aunts now.

692
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,400
They left.

693
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,400
What do you mean?
When did they leave?

694
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,500
They said to give you a message:

695
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:30,700
"Clean up your own mess. "

696
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Oh, God!

697
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:45,200
You stop this, Jimmy!
You stop it!

698
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:46,400
He's making them grow.

699
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,500
He's trying to get to us
by making them grow!

700
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:51,500
You leave us alone!

701
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:54,600
Stop it, Gillian!
Stop it!

702
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:55,700
Stop it!

703
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:58,800
What?

704
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:00,900
His boots!

705
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,100
Oh, my God!

706
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:08,300
Is he rising?

707
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,500
Or is the ground sinking?

708
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:23,700
What is he doing to us?
He's trying to get--

709
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:26,900
Go inside.
Take care of the kids.

710
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
It's early for roses, isn't it?

711
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,100
Can I help you with something?

712
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:59,200
I sure hope so.
Name's Gary Hallet.

713
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:02,300
Special investigator,
prosecutor's office in Tucson.

714
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:12,700
You sure are a long way
from home, Officer.

715
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:13,900
Yes, ma'am.

716
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
I was kind of hoping to talk
to your sister, Gillian.

717
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:20,100
If she's around.

718
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:23,200
She might have some information
on a case I'm working on.

719
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,300
All right, I'll get her.

720
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:33,700
How did you know
that I was her sister?

721
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:38,900
Lucky guess, I guess.

722
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:44,100
Why don't you come inside?

723
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,400
A cop looking for Jimmy
wants to talk to you.

724
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,500
And I think I'm having
a heart attack.

725
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:55,600
Just calm down.

726
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:56,600
Calm down.

727
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,900
What is the question? The question is:
"How much can he know?"

728
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:06,900
He seems to know a lot because
he's come all the way from Arizona.

729
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:10,100
And I know this sounds
really strange. . .

730
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,200
. . .but I don't think
I can lie to him.

731
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,300
Of course you can lie to him.

732
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,400
Breathe, breathe.

733
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,400
Here's the story, right?
Here's the story.

734
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:20,600
I left him. . .

735
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:22,700
. . .because he hit me.

736
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:25,700
And we haven't seen him since.
It's as simple as that.

737
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,900
You just let me handle the rest.

738
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,100
-Okay, good.
-All right?

739
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Left him because he hit you
and haven't seen him-- What?

740
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,200
Is he cute?

741
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:37,300
Yeah. He's nice.

742
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,300
In a very. . .

743
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,400
. . .penal code sort of way.

744
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,500
I left him because she hit him. . . .

745
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:58,100
Just herbs.

746
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,200
From the garden.

747
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:07,500
So what brings you to the island?

748
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:11,700
This.

749
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
You read my letter?

750
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Yes, ma'am, I did.

751
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:23,100
It was a very personal letter.

752
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:25,300
Yes, ma'am, it was.

753
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:29,400
What?

754
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,500
I'm sorry.

755
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,600
-You seem familiar.
-Hello, there.

756
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:37,700
Morning, Miss--

757
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:39,900
Good morning, Miss Owens.

758
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:40,900
Good morning. . .

759
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:42,000
. . .Mr. . .?

760
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Mr. Hallet.

761
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:47,100
I'm not going to
beat around the bush.

762
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,200
I need to find your boyfriend,
James Angelov.

763
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,400
I don't know where he is.

764
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:56,600
I wouldn't exactly call him
my boyfriend.

765
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:00,600
He's more like a big mistake.

766
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,800
Is that his handiwork there?

767
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:07,900
If a man hits me,
he only does it once.

768
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:12,100
Can I take a peek at your. . .?

769
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:17,300
Now, I can tell. . .

770
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:21,500
. . .that you've never touched a woman
in anger all your life.

771
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,600
May I have my hand back, please?

772
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:25,700
You're telling me
you have no idea where he is?

773
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:27,800
I told you.

774
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:30,900
He hit me
and I haven't seen him since.

775
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
When was that?

776
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Three days ago.

777
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:36,100
Right, Sal? Three days.

778
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,200
Excuse me.

779
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:41,300
Whose car is that
in the driveway?

780
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,400
The one with
the Arizona plates?

781
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:45,500
That's my car.

782
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:46,600
That's your car.

783
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:49,700
Plate number 2-2-9 M-O-B?

784
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,800
That's James L. Angelov's car.

785
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:54,900
Come on now.

786
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,100
We stole it, and it's a crime.

787
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:04,200
I know this,
but he basically kidnapped her.

788
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:06,400
He kidnapped you?

789
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:11,500
He didn't really kidnap her.
He sort of, like. . .

790
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:12,700
. . .a little nap.

791
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:15,700
No, there was a car and she--

792
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:21,100
What happened was, that she--

793
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,200
You should know,
she has the worst taste in men.

794
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:26,300
Well, you do.

795
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:30,400
So I picked her up and I drove her
right back here.

796
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,400
And we would be. . .

797
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:36,600
. . .so happy to give him back his car,
because it is a crime--

798
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:37,800
As you say. . .

799
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:41,900
. . .you just don't know where he is. . .

800
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
. . .to give him back that car.

801
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:47,000
So basically,
nobody knows where he is.

802
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,200
I'm sorry, what?

803
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,300
You don't have any idea
where he is?

804
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:56,500
Would you mind if I just
took a look around?

805
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,600
Good.

806
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:03,800
What is wrong with you?

807
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:05,900
I don't know!

808
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
This young lady's name
was Phoebe Stone.

809
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:12,100
Two years ago,
she was found strangled. . .

810
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:15,300
. . .Iying on the side of the highway.

811
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,400
Her body had been marked. . .

812
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:18,400
. . .with a kind of brand. . .

813
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:22,400
. . .burned right into the face.

814
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:25,600
Any help you ladies can give me. . .

815
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:27,800
. . .in locating this
ex-friend of yours. . .

816
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:29,900
. . .would sure be appreciated.

817
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:49,700
She's all yours.

818
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:56,000
Go arrest her!

819
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Their niece owns a shop where
they cook up a special placenta.

820
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:04,200
And that's why the aunts don't age.
I tell you, they just don't age.

821
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:08,400
-She's selling placentas?
-A placenta bar.

822
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:11,400
On Halloween, they all
jump off the roof and fly!

823
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:13,700
When they get mad at you,
they hex you.

824
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:17,700
I wouldn't be surprised if he
turned up in a ditch somewhere.

825
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Sara, that is not true.

826
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
-She's not saying they murdered him.
-Yes, I am.

827
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:27,200
Just that maybe they shook
his hand and then he died.

828
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:29,300
It's very mysterious.

829
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:32,400
If any man dared take on
an Owens woman. . .

830
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:35,500
. . .he'd live briefly in
the euphoria of her love. . .

831
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:37,700
. . .until meeting an untimely death.

832
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:40,800
The curse.

833
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:42,900
Witch? Yeah.

834
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:43,900
Evil? No.

835
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:47,000
You get your psychos now and then,
animal slaughter. . .

836
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:51,200
. . .ritual human disembowelment,
but that's really pretty rare.

837
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,300
See, it's a pagan label.

838
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:54,400
It's Sally.

839
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,500
She's definitely not
into that stuff.

840
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:01,700
She's not?

841
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:02,700
Miss Owens. . .

842
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:05,700
. . .I have a bone to pick with you.

843
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:06,900
What can I do for you, Dwight?

844
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,900
I could've gone
to a qualified doctor. . .

845
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,900
. . .to attend to this
scalp condition of mine.

846
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,200
Now, the more I use,
the less it works.

847
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,300
The product doesn't work.

848
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:20,300
That's because it doesn't
go on your head.

849
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:21,500
If I don't put it on my head. . .

850
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,600
. . .where the hell else would it go?

851
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:27,700
Try to remember.

852
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,100
My mistake.

853
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:42,300
There you go.

854
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,400
Strange town.

855
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:47,500
Never spent this much
on shampoo before. . .

856
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:49,600
. . .in my life.

857
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:57,900
Am I under some kind of surveillance?

858
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:00,100
Should you be?

859
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:02,100
If you want to know
something, ask me.

860
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,200
I already did.

861
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:08,300
And there appears to be something
missing from your story.

862
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:15,600
I want to talk to you more,
but I got to finish some homework.

863
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:18,700
How's about I come by your house
tomorrow morning?

864
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:20,900
Fine.

865
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:21,900
1 0 a.m.?

866
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Fine.

867
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:27,000
That's a date.

868
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:10,900
Jimmy, is that you?

869
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:19,300
Go away.

870
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,400
Go away.

871
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,900
To banish unwanted persons,
it says you need blessing seeds.

872
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:37,000
All right. Good.

873
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,100
-What about nigellus seeds?
-It's the same thing.

874
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:43,300
Wow, is it?

875
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:45,300
Good. You're good at this.

876
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:48,400
Why can't we tell Mommy
we're sending the policeman away?

877
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:51,500
Your mommy likes to pretend
she doesn't do magic.

878
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:55,700
And we must banish this man
for your mommy's own good.

879
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:58,900
Blessing seeds. Right.
What else do we need?

880
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
I told you to listen out the door
for Mr. Hallet.

881
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:04,100
Blessing seeds. . . .

882
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:09,300
Oh, yeah, milk thistle.
I can't find anything here.

883
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,400
Was this Mommy's?

884
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:15,600
Yeah. Where did you get that?

885
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:18,700
"He can flip pancakes in the air.

886
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,800
He'll have one green eye, one blue.

887
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:23,900
Hear my call a mile away. "

888
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Was it about Daddy?

889
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:31,200
Yeah.

890
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:34,200
But Daddy had brown eyes.

891
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:39,600
You know. . .

892
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:42,700
. . .the truth is, this wasn't
about your daddy.

893
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:46,700
This was when your mommy
was little. . .

894
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:49,900
. . .and she was trying to invent
a guy who didn't exist. . .

895
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:52,100
. . .to protect herself.

896
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:54,000
It's crazy.

897
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:55,200
But. . . .

898
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:58,300
She loved your daddy.

899
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:01,400
She loved him very, very much.

900
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,600
I can't wait to fall in love.

901
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:13,800
Kylie, listen to me.

902
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:20,200
Do you ever put your arms out
and spin really fast?

903
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:23,200
-She does it all the time.
-She does?

904
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:25,400
That's what love is like.

905
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,400
It makes your heart race.

906
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:30,600
It turns the world upside-down.

907
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:33,800
But if you're not careful. . .

908
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:37,900
. . .if you don't keep your eyes
on something still. . .

909
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,100
. . .you can lose your balance.

910
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:45,200
You can't see what's happening
to the people around you.

911
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:52,500
You can't see that you're
about to fall.

912
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:55,700
Don't be sad, Aunt Gillian.

913
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:59,800
I won't let you fall down.

914
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:00,900
He's here! He's here!

915
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,900
Make sure you tell him
about breakfast. Go!

916
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:10,200
You came for breakfast.
We're having pancakes.

917
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:13,400
I just came to talk to your mom.

918
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,400
Great!
She's having pancakes too.

919
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,500
Do you have a gun?

920
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:20,700
Can I see it?

921
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,800
He's here for breakfast.

922
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:30,100
I have a question or two.

923
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:33,100
-He's going to stay!
-Oh, good! Good work.

924
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:38,200
Now go back out there
and keep them away from here.

925
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:41,600
Belladonna.

926
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:46,600
A sedative. People put it in
their tea to relax, calm their nerves.

927
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:49,800
Some people also use it as a poison.

928
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:51,900
Which people?

929
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:55,000
Witch people.

930
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:56,200
Witches.

931
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:59,300
I guess you found me out, huh?

932
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:01,400
I did.

933
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:04,400
You should come here on Halloween.

934
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:05,500
You'd really see something.

935
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:06,600
Yeah?

936
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:09,500
We all jump off the roof and fly.

937
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,700
We kill our husbands too.

938
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,900
Or is that outside
your jurisdiction?

939
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,900
Do you have any idea how strange
this all sounds to me?

940
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:24,100
I got people telling me you're
here cooking up placenta bars. . .

941
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:26,300
. . .you're into devil worship--

942
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:29,300
No, there's no devil in the craft.

943
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,600
So what kind of. . .

944
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:33,700
. . .craft do you do?

945
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:35,600
Do I do?

946
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:38,700
I manufacture bath oils.

947
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
And soaps and hand lotions. . .

948
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
. . .and shampoo.

949
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:45,200
And the aunts. . .

950
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:48,200
. . .they like to meddle
in people's love lives.

951
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:53,500
Magic isn't. . .

952
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,600
. . .just spells and potions.

953
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:00,800
Your badge?

954
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:12,200
It's just a star.

955
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:14,400
Just another symbol.

956
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:15,500
Your talisman.

957
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:19,600
It can't stop criminals
in their tracks. . .

958
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:20,700
. . .can it?

959
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:24,800
It has power because
you believe it does.

960
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:36,400
Wish you could believe in me.

961
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:41,600
Miss Owens. . .

962
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:45,700
. . .are you hiding James Angelov?

963
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:47,800
Not in this house.

964
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:54,000
Did you or your sister
kill James Angelov?

965
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:57,200
Oh, yeah.
Couple of times.

966
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:01,300
Antonia, could you make
more of a mess?

967
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,400
-Mom, I'm cooking.
-I can see that.

968
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:05,600
Hey, there.

969
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,500
Did you ever see a saguaro cactus?

970
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:11,700
Step aside, you.

971
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:13,900
You're about to.

972
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,900
One stack of flapjacks. . .

973
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,000
. . .and. . .

974
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:43,000
. . .goodbye, Mr. Hallet.

975
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:46,200
He knows how to flip pancakes.

976
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:50,400
I assume you don't want pancakes.

977
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:53,400
No, we want them!
We want them!

978
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,600
Be careful. They tend to use
those as Frisbees.

979
01:11:57,700 --> 01:12:00,600
Can you ride a pony backwards?

980
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,900
Backwards, forwards, sideways,
you name it.

981
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:06,900
Okay, first troll.

982
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Look.

983
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:09,200
A star!

984
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,200
-This is not yours.
-That's all right.

985
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,400
Second troll.

986
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:19,500
And if you're anything like my girls. . .
here. It'll keep you clean.

987
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,600
Isn't this cozy?

988
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:24,800
Hi, Gary.

989
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,800
I can call you Gary, can't l?

990
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:27,900
Why not?

991
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Coffee?

992
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
You must try my syrup.

993
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,100
Here's the syrup.

994
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:35,200
No! No!

995
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:54,000
Ready?

996
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Go!

997
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:58,100
Okay, yes!

998
01:12:58,100 --> 01:12:59,100
Let's go.

999
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:01,300
I guess they didn't want
to eat that.

1000
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:03,200
I guess not.

1001
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:32,500
I've been looking for this.

1002
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:36,700
This is his party trick.

1003
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,700
It's your ring, is it?

1004
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:40,800
Could I have it?

1005
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,900
What do you think
you're playing at?

1006
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
What do you mean?

1007
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:50,300
You better get yourselves
a damn good lawyer.

1008
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:53,400
And don't even think
about leaving town.

1009
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:57,500
What was in that syrup?

1010
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:03,800
We just stick to our stories.
No body, no crime.

1011
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:06,900
Oh, I'm sorry.

1012
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:10,000
I'm feeling like shit.

1013
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,100
I'm not sleeping.

1014
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:12,200
I. Me. Mine.

1015
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:14,300
That's all you can think about.

1016
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:15,400
You.

1017
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:17,400
It's all about you.

1018
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:22,600
-I don't want to fight.
-Don't walk away from me.

RESYNC BY BSpidey87

1019
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,700
I'm sick and tired
of cleaning up your messes.

1020
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:30,900
Yeah, you're right.
You're always right.

1021
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:34,000
I'm just a mess.

1022
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:36,100
Just one big mess!

1023
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:40,200
At least I've lived my life.

1024
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:43,300
You hate me for it because
it scares the hell out of you.

1025
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:45,500
Gillian, I don't hate you.

1026
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:49,600
You spend all your energy
trying to fit in, be normal!

1027
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,700
But you'll never fit in.

1028
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:54,800
Because we're different!
And so are your girls.

1029
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:57,900
You leave them out of this.

1030
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,000
All my life, I've wished
I had half your talent.

1031
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:05,200
You're wasting yourself!

1032
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:08,300
I want you out of here.
I want you gone.

1033
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,500
Okay, fine.

1034
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:13,600
I'm gone.

1035
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:14,800
Good.

1036
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:18,900
What? What are you doing?

1037
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:20,000
Where are you going?

1038
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,100
I'm doing the right thing.

1039
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:26,100
You're not telling him
what happened!

1040
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:29,300
Funny. The moment he walked in,
that's all I want to do.

1041
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:31,400
Will you get on your knees
and beg for mercy?

1042
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:36,500
You want me to be true to myself?

1043
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:38,600
Then watch this.

1044
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:59,500
It's the goddamn Twilight Zone.

1045
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:08,800
-It was Jimmy's ring.
-Oh, really.

1046
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:10,900
I know you knew that,
but I needed to tell you.

1047
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:13,000
I was serious back there.

1048
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:15,200
Get yourself a lawyer
before you talk to me.

1049
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:17,300
I don't want a lawyer.

1050
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:25,700
All right.

1051
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:32,800
Come on in.

1052
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:35,000
Excuse the mess.

1053
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,100
Wasn't expecting company.

1054
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:41,300
Have yourself a seat.

1055
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:45,400
Let's see what I'll need here.

1056
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:50,600
You don't need to look
at that stuff.

1057
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:03,200
How many times
did you read my letter?

1058
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:05,300
A few.

1059
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:09,300
I have to study all the evidence.

1060
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:13,500
Okay, you want to sit down?

1061
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:16,600
This is the testimony of Sally Owens.

1062
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:18,700
March 8th, 1 998.

1063
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,900
You going to sit down?

1064
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:34,300
Where is James Angelov?

1065
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:36,500
I think he's in the spirit world.

1066
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:39,600
-You think he's dead.
-No, I think he's haunting us.

1067
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,900
What evidence did you get
from reading my letter?

1068
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,100
Did you or your sister. . .

1069
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:51,100
. . .kill James Angelov?

1070
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:55,200
Gillian didn't kill anybody.

1071
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:57,400
Gillian didn't.

1072
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,400
Gillian didn't, but you did?

1073
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:04,600
Did you?

1074
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:06,800
Sally, did you?

1075
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,900
What if I told you I did?
What would you do?

1076
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:19,100
Would you send me to jail
for life all because. . .

1077
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:21,300
. . .the world was short a man
like Jimmy Angelov?

1078
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:24,400
It's not for you or me to decide
how he should be punished.

1079
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:30,800
He has to be held accountable.

1080
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,800
Well, he has been punished.

1081
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
He has?

1082
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:49,400
You should get a lawyer's advice
before we go any further.

1083
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:52,700
Now listen.

1084
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:55,800
I know you're in
some kind of trouble.

1085
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:57,700
All right?

1086
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,900
If you will trust me. . .

1087
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,100
. . .tell me what you know. . .

1088
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:05,000
. . .I promise you. . .

1089
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:10,200
. . .I will do everything I can
to keep you from harm's way.

1090
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:31,100
I can't, I can't, I can't.

1091
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:33,200
I can't either, I'm sorry.

1092
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
One green eye, one blue.

1093
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:58,200
I can't, I can't.

1094
01:19:58,300 --> 01:19:59,300
I've got to go.

1095
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,600
I was born with it.

1096
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:10,900
Mommy.

1097
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:21,300
I need you.

1098
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
What's going on?

1099
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:40,100
I didn't do anything.

1100
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:43,100
Go downstairs. It's okay.

1101
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:10,400
Officer Hallet.

1102
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:16,400
Just looking at you
makes me homesick.

1103
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:03,500
What's wrong?

1104
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:06,700
Cat got your tongue?

1105
01:22:55,700 --> 01:22:56,700
Someday. . .

1106
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:58,700
. . .you'll explain this all to me.

1107
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:17,500
What was that, Sally?

1108
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:19,500
That was him, wasn't it?

1109
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:21,600
Is he gone, or what?

1110
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:23,800
You killed his spirit,
but I took his life.

1111
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,800
I'll tell you all you need to know.
How I did it, where I buried him.

1112
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,100
I'll tell you what I did it with.
I'll tell you how l--

1113
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:34,100
Hold on just a goddamn second,
all right?

1114
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:36,200
One step at a time.

1115
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,400
I took an oath to uphold the law.

1116
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:41,400
I came here
to bring in the bad guy.

1117
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:43,600
Generally, that's what I do.

1118
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,100
You asked me how many times
I read your letter.

1119
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:59,100
I must've read it about
1 000 times.

1120
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:05,300
It was your letter that
brought me here. It was you.

1121
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:09,600
And I'm all mixed-up about that.

1122
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,000
The reason you're here
and you don't know why. . .

1123
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:23,200
. . .is because I sent for you.

1124
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:28,400
When I was a little girl. . .

1125
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,600
. . .I worked a spell. . .

1126
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:36,700
. . .so I would never fall in love.

1127
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:43,000
I asked for qualities in a man
that I knew couldn 't possibly exist.

1128
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:47,100
One green eye, one...

1129
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:48,200
...blue?

1130
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:53,400
But you do.

1131
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:58,600
You're saying
what I'm feeling is just. . .

1132
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,700
. . .one of your spells?

1133
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:02,900
Yeah. It's not real.

1134
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:08,900
If you stay, I wouldn't know
if it was because of the spell. . .

1135
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:14,200
. . .and you wouldn't know if it was
because I didn't want to go to prison.

1136
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:22,700
You know, all relationships
have problems.

1137
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:32,000
I'm right, aren't l?

1138
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:36,100
You don't know, do you?

1139
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:47,600
Why don't you do what you do. . .

1140
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:49,700
. . .and I do what I do. . .

1141
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:53,900
. . .and we'll see where we end up.

1142
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:07,400
Curses only have power
when you believe in them.

1143
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:10,500
And I don't.

1144
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:15,900
You know what?

1145
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
I wished for you too.

1146
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:20,300
I'm feeling very
into sisters right now.

1147
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Come on.

1148
01:27:36,100 --> 01:27:37,100
Oh, dear.

1149
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:39,200
It seems we've not arrived
in the nick of time.

1150
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:44,300
I see our instincts are getting
a little rusty.

1151
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:46,500
He's squatting inside her
like a toad.

1152
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:48,700
This is what comes from dabbling.

1153
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:51,700
You can't practice witchcraft
while you look down your nose at it.

1154
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:52,800
I know.

1155
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:54,900
I know.

1156
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:57,900
Just tell me what to do
and I'll do it.

1157
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:01,000
-We must banish him.
-Force his spirit back to the grave.

1158
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:04,200
-We need a full coven.
-Nine women.

1159
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:06,300
Twelve's better.

1160
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:08,400
Do you have any friends?

1161
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:10,500
Linda!

1162
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:11,500
It's Sally.

1163
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:13,600
I'm activating the phone tree.

1164
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:16,700
You know the stuff everyone
whispers about me. . .

1165
01:28:16,900 --> 01:28:18,800
. . .the hexes, the spells?

1166
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:20,000
Well, here's the thing.

1167
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,000
I'm a witch!

1168
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,000
I got the best news.

1169
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:27,100
Sally just came out.

1170
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:30,200
What a fabulous affirmation.

1171
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:33,300
Her sister just got out of
a bad relationship. . .

1172
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:35,500
. . .and now the guy
won't leave her alone.

1173
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:03,700
Oh, can you bring a broom?

1174
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,000
-I see headlights.
-Mom, they're here!

1175
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:40,100
Come on! They're here!

1176
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:43,200
It's in the kitchen!
ln the side door!

1177
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:47,400
Come in!
It's so good of you to come.

1178
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:51,500
No, now's not the time to be shy.
Come on in.

1179
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:54,700
Grab yourselves a spoon.
You can stir right over there.

1180
01:29:56,900 --> 01:30:00,900
You get right over here and grab
that spoon and dig right in.

1181
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:03,300
Doesn't that look great?

1182
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:06,300
And the fumes are great for the pores.

1183
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:10,400
Not to mention sealing his nasty
spirit back into the grave.

1184
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:13,600
Once, I was across town,
my daughter had a nightmare.

1185
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:16,700
I swear, I could hear her crying.

1186
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:18,800
There's a little witch in all of us.

1187
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:21,900
Everything's almost ready, Aunt Jet.

1188
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:28,200
I didn't expect you here.

1189
01:30:28,300 --> 01:30:32,300
Ever since I was a little girl,
I've wanted to see inside your house.

1190
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:34,400
Thank you for coming.

1191
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:35,500
Is this okay?

1192
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:37,600
It's all I had.

1193
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:40,700
Ladies, let's begin.

1194
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
All right, ladies, pick a broom.

1195
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Form a circle.

1196
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:50,100
Holy shit!

1197
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:58,400
I've been strung out
by a guy before, but this. . . .

1198
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:08,900
Each of you
pick up your brooms.

1199
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Hold them at staff length. . .

1200
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:14,100
. . .handle to brush.

1201
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:18,200
Remember that as we go forth. . .

1202
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:21,300
. . .it is only with our hearts
beating as one. . .

1203
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:23,400
. . .that we can save the life
of this child.

1204
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:43,300
Are we supposed to say this?

1205
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:30,200
Stop it. Stop it!

1206
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:32,300
We're killing her!

1207
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:42,600
Fight this, you bitch!

1208
01:32:51,100 --> 01:32:52,100
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1209
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:54,200
Gilly! Gilly, honey!

1210
01:32:56,300 --> 01:32:58,300
It's okay. I love you.

1211
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:06,700
Stay with me.

1212
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:11,900
Please.

1213
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:16,100
Please, just let him take me.

1214
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:19,200
No, you have to hold on.

1215
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:21,300
Gill, you have to stay with me.

1216
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:25,400
Gilly. No, stay with me.

1217
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:27,500
Gilly, stay with me.

1218
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:29,600
He wants. . .

1219
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:30,700
. . .me.

1220
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:32,800
Just me.

1221
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:33,800
No.

1222
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:37,900
Everyone will be safe.

1223
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:40,100
Just let him. . .

1224
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:42,000
. . .take me.

1225
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:50,500
Don't die on me, Gilly Owens, please.

1226
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:53,500
Because we're supposed
to die together, remember?

1227
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:54,700
The same time.

1228
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:58,700
You promised me that.
And this is not that day.

1229
01:33:58,900 --> 01:34:00,900
I love you, Sally.

1230
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:07,200
Okay, wait.

1231
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:10,300
I've got it.
Get them back in the circle.

1232
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:36,300
Hey, Jimmy, I got a worm
with your name on it.

1233
01:34:42,700 --> 01:34:44,700
You thirsty?

1234
01:34:57,300 --> 01:34:59,300
Is this what you want?

1235
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:00,400
Well, this. . .

1236
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:02,400
. . .you can't have.

1237
01:35:06,700 --> 01:35:07,700
My blood.

1238
01:35:08,700 --> 01:35:09,700
Your blood.

1239
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:10,800
Our blood!

1240
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:11,800
Maria's blood. Now!

1241
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:13,800
Push her in.

1242
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:31,500
I love you, Gillian.

1243
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:51,500
We did it!

1244
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:54,600
Heads up, ladies.

1245
01:35:55,700 --> 01:35:56,700
Ashes to ashes. . .

1246
01:35:57,600 --> 01:35:58,700
. . .dust to dust.

1247
01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:07,000
I wonder if that would work
on my ex-husband?

1248
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:09,000
Come on, ladies. . .

1249
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:11,200
. . .Iet's clean house!

1250
01:36:12,300 --> 01:36:13,300
Get him out of here!

1251
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:15,400
Come along, ladies.

1252
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:16,500
Through the kitchen!

1253
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:19,600
Follow me!

1254
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:21,500
Well done!

1255
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:26,700
Sweep him to the roses.

1256
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:14,800
There's something for you.

1257
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,000
From Arizona.

1258
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:33,500
"Dear Miss Owens:
Any further investigations. . . .

1259
01:37:34,700 --> 01:37:37,700
Office hereby concluded
James Angelov's cause of death was. . .

1260
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:39,900
. . .accidental.

1261
01:37:41,900 --> 01:37:45,000
Jewelry in ashes of structure
provided positive identification.

1262
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:47,200
Sincerely, Gary Hallet. . .

1263
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:49,300
. . .Special lnvestigator. "

1264
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:54,400
I don't think he's in there.

1265
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:03,800
What would you do?

1266
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
What wouldn't I do. . .

1267
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
. . .for the right guy?

1268
01:39:26,300 --> 01:39:30,300
Can love travel back in time
and heal a broken heart?

1269
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:34,500
Was it ourjoined hands that
finally lifted Maria 's curse?

1270
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:38,600
I'd like to think so.

1271
01:39:40,900 --> 01:39:43,900
There are some things
I know for certain:

1272
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Always throw spilled salt
over your left shoulder.

1273
01:39:48,200 --> 01:39:50,200
Keep rosemary by your garden gate.

1274
01:39:50,300 --> 01:39:52,300
Plant lavender for luck.

1275
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:54,500
And fall in love whenever you can.
