1
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,920
- Is everything ready? - Oui, monsieur.
- You have your instructions.

2
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,360
Everything all right, Mrs Ho?

3
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,520
Dinner will be ready at 7.30.

4
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,920
- Good evening.
- I don't know if...

5
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,840
You are expected, Colonel.
May I take your coat?

6
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,720
- It is Colonel Mustard?
- No, that's not my name...

7
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,280
Tonight, you may well feel obliged
to my employer for the use of an alias.

8
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,600
- And who are you?
- Wadsworth, sir. The butler.

9
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,160
Yvette, give the Colonel
anything he requires.

10
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,320
Within reason, that is.

11
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,640
Wadsworth, I was...

12
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,560
Come in, madam. You are expected.

13
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,800
- You know who I am?
- You are to be known as Mrs White.

14
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,520
Yes, it said so in the letter. But why?

15
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,600
May I introduce you?
Mrs White, this is Yvette, the maid.

16
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,840
I see you know each other.

17
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,360
- Hello.
- Hello.

18
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:04,080
- Want a lift?
- Yes, please!

19
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,320
- Thanks. I'm late for a dinner date.
- Me too. Where are you going?

20
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,320
Let's see... Hill House, off Route 41.

21
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:22,560
Wait, let me look. That's where I'm going.
I got a letter like this.

22
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,800
- And this is Mrs Peacock.
- How do you do?

23
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,520
Yvette, check dinner will be ready
as soon as all the guests have arrived.

24
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,560
- Is this the address for Mr Boddy?
- You must be Mr Green.

25
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,560
Sit!

26
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,040
No... Not you, sir.

27
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,600
It should be just off there.

28
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,400
That must be it.

29
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,280
- Why has the car stopped?
- It's frightened.

30
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,880
What a God-forsaken place!

31
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,880
Professor Plum! Miss Scarlet!

32
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,040
- I didn't know you were acquainted.
- We weren't.

33
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:42,240
May I present Professor Plum
and Miss Scarlet?

34
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,120
You've each been addressed
by a pseudonym.

35
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,600
Nobody here is being addressed
by their real name.

36
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,680
Ah, dinner.

37
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,720
I'm sorry. I'm a little accident-prone.

38
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:27,520
You'll find your names
beside your places. Please be seated.

39
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,200
- Is this place yours?
- No, sir. I'm a butler.

40
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,280
- What exactly do you do?
- I buttle, sir.

41
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,680
The butler is head of the kitchen
and dining-room. I keep things tidy.

42
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,880
What's all this about, this dinner party?

43
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,160
Ours not to reason why,
ours but to do and die.

44
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,640
- Die?
- Merely quoting Tennyson, sir.

45
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:02,640
I prefer Kipling. "The female of the
species is more deadly than the male."

46
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,560
- You like Kipling?
- I'll eat anything.

47
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,880
Soup.

48
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,600
- For our host?
- For the seventh guest, Mr Boddy.

49
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,840
- I thought Mr Boddy was our host.
- So did I.

50
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,360
So, who is our host, Mr Wadsworth?

51
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,680
- I want to start.
- Wait for the other guest.

52
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,600
- I'll keep something warm for him.
- What did you have in mind?

53
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,120
Well, someone's got to break the ice,
so why not me?

54
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,280
I'm often a hostess,
for my husband's work.

55
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,800
It's always hard, when new friends
meet for the first time, to get acquainted,

56
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,000
so I'm prepared
to start the ball rolling.

57
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:22,320
I have no idea why we're here,
why I'm here, what this place is about,

58
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,120
but I am determined to enjoy myself.
I'm very intrigued,

59
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,120
and this soup's delicious, isn't it?

60
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,880
You are often a hostess
for your husband?

61
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,680
Yes, it's an integral part of your life
when you are the wife of a...

62
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:45,280
I forgot, we mustn't say who we are,
though I don't know why.

63
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,280
- Don't you?
- I know who you are.

64
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,680
- Will you tell?
- How do you know?

65
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,840
I work in Washington, too.

66
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,400
- So you're a politician's wife?
- Yes, I am.

67
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,880
Come on, then. Who's your husband?

68
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,800
- So what does your husband do?
- Nothing.

69
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:16,160
- He lies around on his back all day.
- Sounds like hard work to me.

70
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,680
I'm sorry!

71
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,680
- I'm a little accident-prone.
- Watch it.

72
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,640
Excusez-moi.

73
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,520
- This is one of my favourite recipes.
- I know, madam.

74
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,920
What do you do in Washington DC,
Mr Green?

75
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:05,720
Come on! How can we get acquainted
if we say nothing about ourselves?

76
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,160
Perhaps he doesn't want to.

77
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,600
I don't know,
but if I wasn't making conversation

78
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,080
we'd be sitting here
in an embarrassed silence.

79
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,640
- Are you afraid of silence?
- Yes... No... Why?

80
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,560
You seem to suffer from what we call
"pressure of speech".

81
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,840
Who's "we"? Are you a shrink?

82
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,840
I do know a little
about psychological medicine, yes.

83
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,480
- A doctor?
- But I don't practise.

84
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:37,080
Practice makes perfect. Most men
need a little practice, don't you think?

85
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,680
- So what do you do?
- I work for the United Nations.

86
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,040
Another politician!

87
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,640
I work for a branch of the UNO,
WHO, the World Health Organisation.

88
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,520
- What is your area of concern?
- Family planning.

89
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,120
- Are you a real colonel?
- I am, sir.

90
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:59,360
You're not going to mention
you also live in Washington DC?

91
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,800
How did you know that?
Have we met before?

92
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,680
I've seen you before.
You may not have seen me.

93
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,080
- Do you live in Washington, too?
- I sure do.

94
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,640
- Does anyone not live in Washington?
- I don't.

95
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,280
But you work for the United Nations,
a government job.

96
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,560
Anyone not earn their living
from the government?

97
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,240
Where's our host
and why have we been brought here?

98
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,640
Good evening.
You are eagerly awaited.

99
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,520
- Locking me in? I'll take the key.
- Over my dead body, sir.

100
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,120
- May I take your bag?
- No.

101
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:50,280
- It contains evidence?
- Surprises, that's what it contains.

102
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,320
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I present Mr Boddy?

103
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,280
- What are they doing here?
- Eating dinner.

104
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,200
- Do sit down, Mr Boddy.
- Thanks.

105
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,240
No, you can take that away, honey.

106
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:18,320
I demand to know what's going on.
Why have we been dragged here?

107
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,240
Well, I believe we all received a letter.

108
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,000
My letter says, "It will be
to your advantage to be present,

109
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:32,880
"because a Mr Boddy will end a certain
long-standing, painful, financial liability."

110
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,200
- Signed, "A friend."
- I got a similar letter.

111
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,720
- So did we, didn't we?
- I also received a letter.

112
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,320
- No, Yvette. I just ate.
- You know her?

113
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,640
We know each other, don't we, dear?

114
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,880
Forgive me,
but was your letter the same?

115
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,760
- No.
- I see.

116
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:01,240
Can I interest any of you in fruit,
or dessert?

117
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,240
I suggest we adjourn
for coffee and brandy,

118
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,480
when I believe our unknown host
will reveal his intentions.

119
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:20,040
- There's no one here.
- Please help yourselves and be seated.

120
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,520
Mind if I smoke?

121
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,360
I'm instructed to explain to you
what you all have in common,

122
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,200
unless you would care to do the honours,
Mr Boddy?

123
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,360
- Why? They know who I am?
- I don't think so.

124
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,840
- It's a hoax. I suggest we all leave.
- You cannot leave this house!

125
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,360
- No? Who's gonna stop me?
- There's no way out.

126
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,120
The windows and doors are locked.

127
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,640
- Outrageous! You can't imprison us!
- Ladies and gentlemen!

128
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,160
Please return to the study.
Everything will be explained.

129
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,280
You too, Mr Boddy.

130
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,600
The other way!

131
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,120
- You can't go that way.
- It's only glass.

132
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:07,200
You all have one thing in common.
You're all being blackmailed.

133
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:14,000
You have all been paying money to
someone who threatens to expose you.

134
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,040
And none of you know
who's blackmailing you.

135
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,960
Please! That's ridiculous.
Nobody could blackmail me.

136
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,800
My life is an open book.
I've never done anything wrong.

137
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,000
Anybody else wish to deny it?

138
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:38,360
As everyone's in the same boat,
there's no harm in revealing details.

139
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,400
And my instructions are to do so.
Thank you, Yvette.

140
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,360
- Can't you spare us this humiliation?
- I'm sorry.

141
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,640
Professor Plum.
You were a psychiatry professor,

142
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,960
helping paranoid, homicidal lunatics
with delusions of grandeur.

143
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,080
- Now I work for the UN.
- The same job.

144
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,360
You don't practise medicine.

145
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,160
- His licence has been lifted.
- Why? What did he do?

146
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,040
You know what doctors mustn't do
with patients? He did.

147
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,560
- How disgusting!
- Are you making moral judgements?

148
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:28,600
Can you justify taking bribes, for handing
your husband's vote to lobbyists?

149
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:34,000
- Nothing wrong with paid consultancy.
- Not if it's publicly declared.

150
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:40,400
But what if it's used greenbacks slipped
under the door of the men's room?

151
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,080
- It stinks.
- Were you in the men's room?

152
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,720
- It's true?
- It's a vicious lie.

153
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,440
I'm sure we're glad to hear that.

154
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:54,080
But you've paid blackmail for over a year
to keep it out of the papers.

155
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,400
I'm being blackmailed
for something I didn't do.

156
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,000
Me too.

157
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,120
- Not me.
- No?

158
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,440
I'm being blackmailed,
but I did what I'm being blackmailed for.

159
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,280
What did you do?

160
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:14,040
I run a service providing gentlemen
with the company of a young lady.

161
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,360
Oh, yeah?

162
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,600
What's the phone number?

163
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,080
You knew the Colonel works
in Washington. Is he a client?

164
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,320
- No!
- I asked Miss Scarlet.

165
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,640
- Say it's not true.
- It's not.

166
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,240
- True?
- No.

167
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,440
- It is true!
- A double negative!

168
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,680
- You have photos?
- Sounds like a confession.

169
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,880
The double negative
has led to proof positive.

170
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,600
Trying to make me look stupid?

171
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,680
- You don't need any help from me.
- Right!

172
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,640
What's so terrible about the Colonel
visiting a house of ill fame?

173
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,000
- Most soldiers do.
- Please!

174
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,000
He holds a sensitive post
in the Pentagon.

175
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:57,040
You drive a very expensive car
for a colonel.

176
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,880
I came into money during the war
when I lost my parents.

177
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,880
Mrs White, you've been paying

178
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,360
since your husband died
under mysterious circumstances.

179
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,080
- Why is that funny?
- That's why he's on his back. In a coffin.

180
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,560
- I didn't kill him.
- So why pay the blackmailer?

181
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:24,960
I don't want a scandal. We'd had
a very humiliating confrontation.

182
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,720
He was deranged. He was lunatic.

183
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,000
He didn't like me.
He threatened to kill me in public.

184
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:36,720
- Why kill you in public?
- He threatened, in public, to kill her.

185
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,800
- Was that his final word?
- Being killed is pretty final.

186
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:47,120
- Yet he was the one who died, not you.
- What did he do for a living?

187
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,040
A scientist. Nuclear physics.

188
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,360
What was he like?

189
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:57,080
A stupidly optimistic man.
It came as a shock to him when he died.

190
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:02,240
He was found at home,
his head had been cut off and his...

191
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,000
You know...

192
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,560
- I'd been at the movies.
- Miss him?

193
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,480
It's life after death.
Now he's dead, I have a life.

194
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:17,480
- Your first husband also disappeared.
- That was his job. An illusionist.

195
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:22,240
- But he never reappeared.
- He wasn't a very good illusionist.

196
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,720
I have something to say.

197
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,080
I'm not going to wait
for Wadsworth to unmask me.

198
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,840
I work for the State Department.
And I'm a homosexual.

199
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:40,080
I feel no personal shame
or guilt about this.

200
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:45,920
But I must keep it a secret
or I'll lose my job on security grounds.

201
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,240
Thank you.

202
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,040
Well...

203
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,840
- That just leaves Mr Boddy.
- What's your little secret?

204
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,800
His secret? Hadn't you guessed?
He's your blackmailer.

205
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,720
- You bastard!
- Colonel!

206
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,360
Put 'em up!

207
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:15,120
- Gentlemen!
- If you can't fight fairly, don't fight.

208
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,400
He called me a bastard!

209
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:23,480
- Was that necessary, Mrs White?
- Wait! The police are coming.

210
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,880
- Oh, no!
- My career is very sensitive...

211
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,080
Listen! Blackmail depends on secrecy.

212
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,640
You admit he's blackmailing you.

213
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,240
Tell the police, convict him,
and it will be over.

214
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,680
It's not so easy.
You'll never tell the police.

215
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,560
I shall. I have evidence,
and this conversation is being recorded.

216
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,840
- Recordings aren't admissible evidence.
- Ladies and gentlemen!

217
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,600
The police will be here
in about 45 minutes.

218
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:59,040
Tell them the truth
and Mr Boddy will be behind bars.

219
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,680
- Where are you going?
- I can help them decide.

220
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,600
I'll get my bag.

221
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,440
- Who can guess what's in here?
- The evidence against us, no doubt.

222
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,800
- Did you know you'd see us tonight?
- Yes.

223
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:30,200
- What were you told?
- That you'd be discussing our little deal.

224
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,720
And if I didn't appear,
Wadsworth would tell the police about it.

225
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,360
Naturally, I could hardly resist
putting in an appearance.

226
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,240
Excuse me.

227
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,840
- Open 'em.
- Why not?

228
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,440
I enjoy getting presents
from strange men.

229
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,880
A candlestick? What's this for?

230
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,360
In your hands,
you each have a lethal weapon.

231
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:03,880
If you denounce me to the police,
you will also be exposed and humiliated.

232
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,720
I'll see to that in court.

233
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,640
But... if one of you kills Wadsworth now,

234
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,680
no one but the seven of us
will ever know.

235
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,360
He has the key to the front door...

236
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:26,160
...which he said would only be opened
over his dead body.

237
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,840
I suggest we take him up on that offer.

238
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:43,320
The only way to stay off the front pages
is for one of you to kill Wadsworth...

239
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,120
Now!

240
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,440
- It's not Wadsworth!
- Is he alive?

241
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,760
Stand back! Give him air. Let me see...

242
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,880
He's dead.

243
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,000
- Who had the gun?
- Me, but I didn't shoot.

244
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,320
You had the gun.
If you didn't, who did?

245
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:24,400
Nobody! No gunshot wound! Somebody
grabbed the gun and it went off.

246
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:28,360
Look, the bullet broke that vase
on the mantle.

247
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,600
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

248
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,160
He's right.
There's a bullet hole in the wall.

249
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:38,720
- How did he die?
- I don't know. I'm not a forensic expert.

250
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,360
- One of us must have killed him.
- I didn't.

251
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,040
I need a drink!

252
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,920
Maybe he was poisoned!

253
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,200
Mrs Peacock, please. It's all right.

254
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:01,160
We don't know anything.
Sit down. Sit down, Mrs...

255
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,520
I... had to stop her from screaming.

256
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,680
- But was the brandy poisoned?
- I don't...

257
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,840
- Looks like we'll never know.
- Unless... Unless she dies too.

258
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,800
- It's locked.
- Open up!

259
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,040
- The murderer!
- Screaming?

260
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,320
- It must be Yvette.
- Oh, my God!

261
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,080
- You're alive!
- No thanks to you.

262
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,760
- You locked me up with a murderer!
- The murderer is in this room?

263
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:58,120
- Where?
- Where? Here!

264
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,520
We are looking at him, or her. As
Mrs White said, one of you is the killer.

265
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,160
- How do you know?
- I was listening.

266
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,800
- But why were you screaming in here?
- I am frightened.

267
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:17,280
I also drink the cogna. Mon Dieu,
I can't stay in here by myself.

268
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,880
- Come with us.
- With the murderer?

269
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,200
There is safety in numbers, my dear.

270
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,800
- No clue how he died?
- No.

271
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:47,560
This is absolutely terrible.
It's not what I intended. Oh, my God!

272
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,440
- Not what you intended?
- You're not the butler?

273
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,840
Not the butler, but a butler.
In fact, I was his butler.

274
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,960
If he invited us, why was he late?

275
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:03,200
I invited you. I wrote the letters.
It was all my idea.

276
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,040
Wait a minute. I don't understand.

277
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,840
Why invite us?
Were you helping him blackmail us?

278
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,520
- Certainly not!
- You had better explain.

279
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,800
Please sit down, everyone.

280
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,600
When I said I was Mr Boddy's butler,
it was true but misleading.

281
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:47,160
I was once his butler. But it was not
his death that ended my employment.

282
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:52,000
- When did it end?
- When my wife decided to end her life.

283
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,680
She too was being blackmailed
by this odious man who lies dead.

284
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,520
He hated my wife
for the same reason he hated you.

285
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,880
He believed you were all
thoroughly un-American.

286
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,160
- Sorry.
- He felt it was inappropriate

287
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:16,560
for a senator to have a corrupt wife,
a doctor to take advantage of patients,

288
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,360
for a wife to emasculate
her husband and... so forth...

289
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,600
It's ridiculous. Why didn't he
report us to the authorities?

290
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:31,880
He decided to use his information
to make some money - very American!

291
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:36,760
- What was your role?
- I was a victim, too.

292
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:41,960
At least, my wife was.
She had friends who were...

293
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,960
- Socialists!
- Oh, my God!

294
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,840
Well, we all make mistakes.

295
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,080
He threatened to report her
unless she named her friends.

296
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,080
She refused, so he blackmailed her.
We had no money.

297
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,600
The price of his silence
was that we work for nothing, like slaves.

298
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,040
- To make a long story short...
- Too late!

299
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,600
The suicide of my wife
created a sense of injustice in me.

300
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,080
I resolved to put Mr Boddy in jail.

301
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:33,000
It seemed the best way to do it,
and free you from blackmail too,

302
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,760
was to get everyone face to face,
confront Mr Boddy with his crimes,

303
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,600
and turn him over to the police.

304
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:46,360
- So, everything is explained.
- We still don't know who killed him.

305
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,960
We have to find out
before the police arrive.

306
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:55,080
- We can't have the police now!
- How can we know which of you did it?

307
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,880
- Why "which of you"?
- I didn't.

308
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:01,000
All of us had the opportunity
and a motive.

309
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,680
- Great!
- Maybe it wasn't one of us.

310
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,960
- Who else?
- Who else is here?

311
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,000
- The cook...
- The cook!

312
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,240
Well, she's not here.

313
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,040
I didn't do it!

314
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,800
Would somebody help me, please?
Help me, please!

315
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:04,160
- Don't touch it, it's evidence.
- We have to find out who did this.

316
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,600
- You'd better explain yourself.
- Me? Why?

317
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,280
- Why kill the cook?
- Dinner was OK.

318
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,440
- How can you make jokes?
- It's my defence mechanism.

319
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,400
Some defence!
If I was the killer, I'd kill you next.

320
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,200
I said "if"...!

321
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:29,120
- The only admitted killer here is her.
- I've admitted nothing.

322
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,440
- How many husbands have you had?
- Mine?

323
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,920
- Yours.
- Five, just five.

324
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,360
Husbands are like Kleenex,
soft, strong, disposable.

325
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,440
You lure them like a spider with flies.

326
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,560
- Flies are where men are vulnerable.
- Right.

327
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:50,640
If it wasn't you, who was it?
Who had the dagger? Mrs Peacock!

328
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,600
- I put it down, in the study.
- When?

329
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:58,320
I don't know...
Before I fainted, after I fainted.

330
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,080
But any of you could have picked it up.

331
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,880
I suggest we take the cook's body
into the study.

332
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,680
- Why?
- I'm the butler. I keep the kitchen tidy.

333
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,480
Look! The body's gone!

334
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,240
- What are you staring at? Who's there?
- Nobody.

335
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,440
- What do you mean?
- No body. Mr Boddy's body has gone.

336
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,360
Maybe he wasn't dead.
We should have made sure.

337
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,040
- By cutting his head off?
- Really!

338
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,240
- Where is he?
- We'd better look for him.

339
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,960
Well...

340
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,960
- He couldn't have been dead.
- He was! At least, I thought he was.

341
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:00,720
- What's the difference?
- Quite a difference to him.

342
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:06,600
- Maybe there is life after death.
- As improbable as sex after marriage.

343
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,760
- Maybe Mr Boddy killed the cook!
- Yes!

344
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,040
How?

345
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,040
If you'll excuse me...
Is there a little girl's room?

346
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:29,440
- Oui, oui, madame.
- No, I just want to powder my nose.

347
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,440
What's this?

348
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,400
- The negatives the Colonel referred to.
- My God!

349
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,520
- Planning to blackmail him?
- Certainly not!

350
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,240
I was going to give them to the Colonel
once Mr Boddy was unmasked.

351
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,720
Very pretty! Want to see?
They might shock you.

352
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,880
- No, I am a lady.
- So how d'you know what they're like?

353
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,720
- What are they like?
- I'd like them back.

354
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:58,800
- Something in them concerns me, too.
- Let me see.

355
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:04,720
- My! Nobody can get into that position.
- Sure they can. Let me show you.

356
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,800
Get off!

357
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,560
Mr Boddy! He's attacking her.

358
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,360
- No, he's dead.
- Mr Boddy, dead? Again?!

359
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,880
- Oh, my God!
- She's fainting.

360
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,480
- Catch her!
- I'll catch her. Fall into my arms.

361
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,920
- Sorry.
- You've got blood on your hands.

362
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,280
I didn't do it!

363
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,080
He's got new injuries.

364
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,040
He's dead now.
Why kill him twice?

365
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,880
- Unnecessary.
- What we call "overkill".

366
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,720
- Psychotic.
- Unless he wasn't dead.

367
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,000
- So what?
- That's what we want to find out!

368
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:01,360
- Who killed him, where, and with what.
- No need to shout.

369
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,640
I'm not shouting!

370
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,880
All right, I am.
I'm shouting, I'm shouting...

371
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,640
OK, put the corpses on the sofa.

372
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,000
Ladies first.

373
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:43,440
- Don't get blood on the sofa.
- The dagger will go further into her back.

374
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,440
Tip her forward, over the arm.

375
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,600
Now Mr Boddy.

376
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,200
Ready...

377
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,520
- A little higher.
- There you go.

378
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,400
Now... Who...

379
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:13,080
- Who had the candlestick?
- It was given to you.

380
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,040
I dropped it.
Anyone could've picked it up.

381
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:22,240
We have all these weapons, the gun,
the rope, the wrench, the lead pipe.

382
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,680
Let's lock them all in this cupboard.
There's a homicidal maniac about.

383
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,200
- That's wise.
- Good idea.

384
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:34,000
- Why are you pocketing the key?
- To keep it safe.

385
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,560
That means you can open it.
What if you're the murderer?

386
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,840
- I'm not.
- What if you are?

387
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,320
It has to go somewhere.
I know I'm safe.

388
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,560
We don't!

389
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,960
- I have an idea. We'll throw it away.
- Good idea.

390
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,200
- Brilliant.
- That'll do it.

391
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,000
Sorry...

392
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,640
Sorry... Can we help?

393
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,200
I didn't mean to disturb
the whole household.

394
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:11,240
My car broke down and I was wondering
if I could use your phone.

395
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,480
Just a moment.

396
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,040
Very well, sir.
Would you care to come in?

397
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,560
- Well, where is it?
- The body?

398
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,520
- The phone. What body?
- No body. Nobody in the study.

399
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,760
- No!
- But there's a phone in the lounge.

400
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,800
Thank you.

401
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:54,280
- When you've finished, please wait here.
- Certainly.

402
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,000
- Where's the key?
- The key to the weapons cupboard.

403
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:16,200
- You still wish me to throw it away?
- Yes!

404
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,320
Well... What now?

405
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,920
- Wadsworth, let me out.
- No, we've got to know who did it.

406
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,960
- If you go, I'll say you killed them both.
- Me too.

407
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:44,880
I'll make you sorry you started this,
one day when we're alone.

408
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,000
No sane man
would be alone with you.

409
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,600
- I could use a drink.
- So could I.

410
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,680
Just checking...
Two corpses, everything's fine.

411
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,400
- Anybody else want a whisky?
- Yeah.

412
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:09,000
All right, look. Pay attention, everybody.

413
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:12,280
Am I right that there is nobody else here?

414
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,560
- No.
- There is someone else.

415
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,240
- No, I said no meaning yes.
- No meaning yes?

416
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,960
I want a straight answer.
Is there someone else? Yes or no?

417
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,480
- No.
- No, there is, or no, there isn't?

418
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,520
- Yes.
- Please!

419
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:35,240
Shouldn't we get rid of that man
before he finds out what's going on?

420
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:39,960
- We can't throw him out.
- If he stays, he'll get suspicious.

421
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,720
- If he goes, he'll be suspicious.
- I'd be suspicious.

422
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:49,520
Who cares? Let him stay locked up
for another half an hour.

423
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:55,680
The police will be here by then, and
there are two dead bodies in the study!

424
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:00,840
There's confusion as to whether
there's anyone else here.

425
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,920
- There isn't.
- Confusion or anybody else?

426
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,600
- Either. Or both.
- Gimme a clear answer.

427
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:10,040
- Certainly. The question?
- Is anybody else here?

428
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:15,200
- No!
- So he says. But does he know?

429
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:21,000
I suggest we do this in military fashion.
We split up and search the house.

430
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,240
- Split up?!
- Yes.

431
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,000
We have very little time,
so we'll split into pairs.

432
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,520
What if one of us is the murderer?

433
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,000
Whoever is left with the killer
might get killed.

434
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:38,040
- Then we'll discover the murderer.
- But one of the pair will be dead!

435
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,560
This is war, Peacock!
Casualties are inevitable.

436
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,960
Making omelettes means breaking eggs,
every cook knows.

437
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:48,360
Look what happened to the cook!

438
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:52,080
- Will you take that chance?
- What choice have we?

439
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,560
- None.
- You're right.

440
00:44:54,760 --> 00:45:00,760
Bon, d'accord. But it is dark upstairs.
Will anyone go with me?

441
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,680
- I will.
- No, thank you.

442
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:08,640
I suggest we all draw lots, for partners.

443
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:34,080
Ready? The two shortest together,
the next two shortest together. Agreed?

444
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:39,160
I suggest the two shortest
search the cellar and so on, up.

445
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,880
It's you and me, honey-bunch.

446
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,040
The cellar.

447
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:50,720
We know what's in the study
and the library.

448
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:55,400
- The stranger's in the lounge.
- Let's go with the billiard-room.

449
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,200
- Want to go in front?
- Absolutely no.

450
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:36,600
- I'm sure there's no one there.
- Then you go.

451
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,920
All right.

452
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:06,000
- Well, ladies first.
- No, you can go first.

453
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,160
- I insist.
- I insist.

454
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,840
- Afraid of a fate worse than death?
- Just death.

455
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,520
- Are you going in there?
- Yes.

456
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,600
- Right.
- Right.

457
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:29,280
- I see no light switches.
- Nor do I. There must be some.

458
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,560
- Shall I come with you?
- No!

459
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:34,640
I mean... No, thank you.

460
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,960
- Ladies first.
- No, thanks.

461
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:29,280
- Go on, I'll be right behind you.
- That's why I'm nervous.

462
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,200
Then we go together.

463
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,560
Stay there!

464
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:04,800
If there's anybody in here, just look out!

465
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,880
Are you hiding? I'm coming!

466
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,320
- What room's this?
- Search me.

467
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,840
- All right.
- Get your mitts off me.

468
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,800
- Nobody here.
- He's behind one of those curtains.

469
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,600
You look. I'll search the kitchen.

470
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,680
I'm a little nervous.

471
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:32,240
I'm in this big house,
and I've been locked into the lounge.

472
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,480
Yes...

473
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:41,360
The funny thing is, there's a group
of people here having a sort of party.

474
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:45,160
And one of them is my old boss from...

475
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,800
Looks like a secret passage.

476
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:40,080
- Shall we see where it leads?
- What the hell?

477
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,800
I'll go first. I've had a good life.

478
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,320
- Oh, God!
- It's all right.

479
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,960
Oh, my God!

480
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,640
Come on! We're locked in here!

481
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,480
Help!

482
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:26,440
Down here! Get us out of here!

483
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:29,480
- Where's it coming from?
- Where are we going?

484
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:32,720
- Where are they?
- The lounge.

485
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:35,960
We're in here!

486
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:38,200
- The door's locked!
- I know!

487
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:40,560
- Where's the key?
- It's gone!

488
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:46,040
- Never mind, unlock the door!
- I can't unlock it without the key!

489
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,000
- Let us in!
- Let us out!

490
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,800
It's no good. Stand back.

491
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:56,120
There's no alternative.
I'll just have to break it down.

492
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,760
- I know, I have it!
- Help!

493
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:05,840
Will you shut up? We're doing our best!

494
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,600
They're shooting at us.

495
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:24,360
- I've been shot!
- Come out! The door is open!

496
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:30,640
- Why are you shooting at us?
- To get you out.

497
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:34,360
You could have killed us.
I could've been killed.

498
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:37,800
I can't take any more scares.

499
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,720
Look!

500
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:51,720
- Which one of you did it?
- We found him, together.

501
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:56,600
- How did you get in?
- There's a secret passage.

502
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:00,080
Is that the same gun?
The cupboard was locked!

503
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,200
- Unlocked.
- Unlocked?

504
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,840
See for yourself.

505
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,840
How did you know
you could get at the gun?

506
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,080
I didn't. I think I break it open,
but it was open already.

507
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,680
A likely story.

508
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,080
Maybe they'll just go away.

509
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:40,120
- I'm going to open it.
- Why?

510
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:45,200
I have nothing to hide, I didn't do it!
The key.

511
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,720
Thank you.

512
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,800
Good evening, sir.

513
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:58,720
- Yes?
- I found an abandoned car at the gate.

514
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:04,040
- Did the driver come in here for help?
- No.

515
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,840
- Well, actually, yes.
- No!

516
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,720
- Seems to be some disagreement.
- No!

517
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,560
Yes.

518
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:18,160
- Can I come in and use your phone?
- Of course, sir.

519
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:21,360
You may use the one in the... No...

520
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,960
You could use the one in the st... No...

521
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:29,680
Would you be kind enough
to wait in... in the library?

522
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,920
Sure.

523
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,440
Don't I know you from someplace?

524
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:43,760
You all seem very anxious.

525
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:48,800
The chandelier fell and almost killed us.
Would you come this way?

526
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:00,960
Frightfully draughty, these old houses.

527
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:06,520
Please help yourself to a drink,
if you'd like.

528
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:10,680
- Not the cognac, just in case.
- In case of what?

529
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,840
What now?

530
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,800
- We should've told.
- You say that now.

531
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,800
- I said it then.
- Oh, shut up!

532
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:28,480
Let's clean this up.

533
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,160
Hello?

534
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:47,360
- Maybe the cop answered it.
- And who shall I say is calling?

535
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,400
Would you hold on, please?

536
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:00,560
Let me outta here!
You have no right to shut me in.

537
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:04,560
I'll book you for false arrest,
wrongful imprisonment,

538
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:09,800
and obstructing an officer
in the course of his duty and murder.

539
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:13,520
What do you mean, "murder"?

540
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:17,920
I just said it so you'd open the door.
What's going on?

541
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:23,280
Why lock me in? Why are you
getting calls from J Edgar Hoover?

542
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:28,760
- J Edgar Hoover?
- That's right. The head of the FBI!

543
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:33,600
- Why is he on your phone?
- He's on everyone's. Why not mine?

544
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,840
Excuse me.

545
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:45,560
- What's going on here?
- We're having a party.

546
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:50,200
- Mind if I look around?
- Sure!

547
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:55,440
- You can show him around, Mr Green.
- Me?

548
00:59:55,600 --> 01:00:01,800
Yes, you can show him the dining-room,
the kitchen, the ballroom...

549
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,080
Fine!

550
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:08,160
Fine. Officer, come with me.

551
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:13,160
I'll show you the dining-room
or the kitchen or the ballroom...

552
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:19,080
Make it look convincing.

553
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:23,920
- So, this is the dining-room.
- No kidding!

554
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:25,680
Come on!

555
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:30,120
- What's going on in those two rooms?
- Which two rooms?

556
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:38,280
- Those two rooms.
- Oh, those two rooms!

557
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:40,520
Yes.

558
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,480
- Officer, you shouldn't go in there.
- Why not?

559
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,520
Because it's all too shocking.

560
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:22,360
It's not all that shocking.
These folks are just having a good time.

561
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:32,680
My God!

562
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,960
Excuse me.

563
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:54,960
- This man's drunk. Dead drunk.
- Dead right!

564
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:01,320
- You're not going to drive home?
- He won't drive, I promise you.

565
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:04,320
- He'll get a lift?
- We'll get him a car.

566
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:07,400
- A long black car.
- A limousine.

567
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:21,040
- Officer!
- I've seen it all.

568
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:24,280
- I can explain everything.
- You don't have to.

569
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:27,960
- Don't worry, it's nothing illegal.
- Are you sure?

570
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,200
- This is America.
- I see.

571
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:35,080
- It's a free country.
- I didn't know it was that free.

572
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:40,840
- May I use your phone now?
- Certainly.

573
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,840
Why lock him in?

574
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:53,560
We haven't finished
searching the house yet!

575
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:58,040
- Only 15 minutes till the police come.
- They already came!

576
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:01,080
- Shut up!
- Let's get on with it.

577
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,840
Look! I can't believe it.
I wonder where this one goes?

578
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,480
Let's find out.

579
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:59,760
Let's try the ballroom again.

580
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:28,400
Don't you touch me!

581
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:44,200
Hello?

582
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:50,520
Shut the door.
Did anyone recognise you?

583
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:56,120
They must have. And not just my face.
They know every inch of my body.

584
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,880
And they're not the only ones.

585
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:01,160
It's you!

586
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:09,720
There's something funny going on
around here, I don't know what it is.

587
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:17,400
No, I'm not on duty.
But I have a feeling that I'm in danger.

588
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:19,920
You know that big, ugly house...

589
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:22,600
Hello?

590
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:24,960
Hello?

591
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,800
Are you there?

592
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,920
I am
Your singing telegram!

593
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,480
I'm coming!
I'm just trying to find the door.

594
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:57,920
- Help me, please!
- Coming.

595
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:02,160
What's this? Another door?

596
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:14,800
Two murders.

597
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:26,080
- Neither was shot. I heard a gun.
- So did I.

598
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:30,560
- I heard the front door slam.
- The murderer must have run out.

599
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:39,120
- Three murders.
- Six altogether.

600
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:43,000
This is getting serious.

601
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:54,160
No gun. Yvette dropped it here.

602
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:59,600
- Very well. I know who did it.
- You do?

603
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:03,520
Furthermore, I'm going to tell you
how it was done.

604
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,800
Follow me.

605
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:14,240
To help you understand, I shall take
you through the events step by step.

606
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:20,560
At the start, Yvette was here by herself,
waiting to offer you champagne.

607
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:23,880
I was in the hall.

608
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:29,760
I know, I was there.
Then I hurried across to the kitchen.

609
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:35,680
The cook was in here, alive,
sharpening knives.

610
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:38,280
And then...

611
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:41,400
The doorbell rang...

612
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:47,440
It was you. I asked for your coat
and stopped you from saying your name

613
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:50,880
as I wanted you to use pseudonyms.
I introduced myself as the butler,

614
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:54,720
and I ran across the hall to the library.

615
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:59,800
Then Yvette met you, and smiled,
and poured you a drink.

616
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:06,520
The doorbell rang. It was Mrs White.
I took her coat and hung it up.

617
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:11,520
I introduced Mrs White
to Colonel Mustard,

618
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:15,280
and I noticed that Mrs White
and Yvette flinched.

619
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:19,360
There was a rumble of thunder
and a crash of lightning.

620
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:21,240
- In short...
- Too late!

621
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,080
You all arrived.

622
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:28,880
Then the gong was struck by the cook
and we went into the dining-room.

623
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:33,120
Mrs Peacock sat here,
Professor Plum here.

624
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:36,280
Mrs White, Mr Green,
Miss Scarlet, Colonel Mustard.

625
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:41,640
This chair was vacant. Anyway,
we all revealed we'd had a letter...

626
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:44,760
- Get on with it!
- The point is, blackmail.

627
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:48,840
- All this came out in the study.
- You're right.

628
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:58,240
Mr Green stood here, Mrs Peacock here,
Miss Scarlet, Professor Plum, Colonel...

629
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:00,920
- Get on with it!
- I'm getting there!

630
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:05,040
Mr Boddy got packages from the hall,
you opened your presents,

631
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:08,120
Mr Boddy switched out the lights...

632
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:16,560
- Oh, my God.
- Grand!

633
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:20,440
- Mr Boddy lay apparently dead.
- He was dead!

634
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:23,440
So why was he bashed
with a candlestick?

635
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:26,080
- OK, I made a mistake!
- Right.

636
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:29,200
But why did Mr Boddy
pretend he was dead?

637
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:32,160
Because he realised
his scheme had misfired.

638
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:35,480
The gunshot was intended to kill him,
not me.

639
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:40,600
The bullet grazed him. He escaped death
by pretending to be dead already.

640
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:43,920
Whoever grabbed the gun
was trying to kill him!

641
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:47,040
What happened next?
Mrs Peacock took a drink.

642
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:51,040
You said, "Maybe it's poisoned."
She screams.

643
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:54,040
We took her to the sofa...

644
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,600
Mr Green...

645
01:10:56,760 --> 01:11:00,240
Well, I had to stop her screaming...

646
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:05,920
Then more screaming. Yvette!
We all rushed to the billiard-room.

647
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:09,280
- But one of us wasn't here. No.
- No?

648
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:12,480
No. Maybe one of us
was murdering the cook.

649
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:16,080
- Who wasn't here with us?
- Do you know?

650
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:21,440
I do. While we stood here,
trying to stop Yvette from panicking,

651
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:24,440
one of us
could have taken the dagger,

652
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:27,280
run down the hall,

653
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:29,800
and stabbed the cook.

654
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:35,440
- We'd have seen them run back.
- Not if they used this secret passage.

655
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:39,040
And the murderer ran
down the passage to the study.

656
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:42,840
- Is that where it comes out?
- Yes, look.

657
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,400
- How did you know?
- This house belongs to a friend.

658
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:50,360
- You could be the murderer.
- Ridiculous!

659
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:54,360
If I was the murderer,
why would I tell you how I did it?

660
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:58,480
- Who else knew of the passage?
- Me and the Colonel found it.

661
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:02,840
- You could've known all along.
- Why should we believe you?

662
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,920
She was with us while Yvette
was screaming, remember?

663
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:11,520
Why was the cook murdered?
She had nothing to do with Mr Boddy.

664
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:18,200
She did! I gathered you here because
you were all implicated in his blackmail.

665
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:22,440
Did none of you deduce
that the others were involved, too?

666
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,680
- Who?
- The cook and Yvette.

667
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:28,560
- No!
- That's how he got his information.

668
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:32,640
Before blackmailing anyone,
he had to discover their secret.

669
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:35,160
The cook and Yvette were accomplices.

670
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:41,320
I see. So, whoever knew
that the cook was involved...

671
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:44,680
...killed her?
- Yes.

672
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:49,520
I know, as Mr Boddy's butler,
that the cook worked for one of you.

673
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:53,320
- Who?
- You recognised Yvette. Don't deny it.

674
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:57,680
- What do you mean? I deny nothing.
- Another denial.

675
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:04,200
OK, I knew Yvette. My husband
had an affair with her. I didn't care.

676
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:07,160
- You knew Yvette.
- She worked for me.

677
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:12,320
You also knew her.
You were one of Miss Scarlet's clients.

678
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:18,360
That's why you wanted those photos.
You and Yvette in flagrante delicto.

679
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:23,480
Mr Boddy threatened to send them
to my mother. It would've killed her.

680
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:28,720
Amazing, since you told us she's
dead already. So, he had the motive.

681
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:32,480
- You all did.
- Where and when was Mr Boddy killed?

682
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:38,040
Don't you see? We came back from
the study. Mr Boddy was on the floor,

683
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:41,480
pretending to be dead.
One of us knows he's alive.

684
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:46,680
I said I'd invited you and we realised
there was only one other person here.

685
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:49,320
The cook!

686
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:58,680
Where is he?

687
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:08,440
She was dead. We laid her down,
our backs to the freezer.

688
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:12,000
- One of us went through the passage...
- Again?

689
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:14,240
...back to the study.

690
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:19,120
The murderer was in the passage.
Mr Boddy had been on the floor.

691
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:21,880
He jumped up...

692
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:25,960
The murderer came out,
picked up the candlestick...

693
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:30,680
Mr Boddy followed us into the hall,
the murderer crept up behind him...

694
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:35,000
- And killed him!
- Will you stop that?

695
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:36,720
No.

696
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:39,640
Then he threw him into the toilet.

697
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:43,760
And joined us in the kitchen.
It took half a minute.

698
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:48,080
- So who wasn't in the kitchen?
- That is the murderer.

699
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:55,960
We put the weapons in here,
locked it, and ran to the door

700
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:58,880
to throw away the key.

701
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:00,520
The motorist!

702
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:04,920
I put the key in my pocket. Someone
could have swapped it for another.

703
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:08,800
- It could have been any one of us.
- Precisely.

704
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:11,040
Wait a minute...

705
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:14,920
Colonel Mustard has a top secret job,

706
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:19,280
Mrs White's husband
was a nuclear physicist, and...

707
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:23,360
Yvette is a link between them.

708
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:27,040
- What is your job, Colonel?
- I can tell you.

709
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:30,120
He's working on the next fusion bomb.

710
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:33,800
- How did you know?
- Keep a secret? Me too.

711
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:38,040
Was this a plot?
Or did Colonel Mustard do it alone?

712
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:41,000
We'll see.
Let's look at the other murders.

713
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:45,000
- Bad luck the motorist arrived.
- No luck. I invited him.

714
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,680
- You did?
- It's obvious.

715
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:50,840
Everyone was Mr Boddy's
victim or accomplice.

716
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,680
Everyone who died gave him
information about one of you.

717
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:57,680
I got them here to force him to confess.

718
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:02,160
What about that motorist?
What information did he have?

719
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:07,760
- He was my driver during the war.
- What was he holding over you?

720
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:12,280
He knew that I was a war profiteer.

721
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:17,600
I stole essential Air Force radio parts
and sold them on the black market.

722
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:21,720
That's how I made my money.
It doesn't make me a murderer.

723
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:26,040
A lot of our airmen died
because their radios didn't work.

724
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:29,160
Was the policeman
working for Mr Boddy, too?

725
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:32,240
The cop was from Washington,
on my payroll.

726
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:37,440
I bribed him so I could carry on
with business. Mr Boddy found out.

727
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:41,760
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, please!

728
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:44,080
And the singing telegram girl?

729
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:52,680
She was my patient once.
I had an affair with her.

730
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:57,440
That's how I lost my licence.
Mr Boddy found that out, too.

731
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:00,960
Let's put her in the study
with the others.

732
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:06,760
So, now you all know why they died.

733
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:10,680
Whoever killed Mr Boddy
wanted his accomplices dead.

734
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:13,040
How did the murderer know?

735
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:17,280
I guessed that the singer
informed on me to Mr Boddy,

736
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:19,920
but I knew nothing of you until now.

737
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:25,200
The murderer needed to get the weapons
and stole the key from my pocket.

738
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:29,120
Then Colonel Mustard suggested
we search the house.

739
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:32,320
That's right! It was his suggestion.

740
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:36,120
One of us slipped away
and hurried to the study.

741
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:40,760
On the desk was the envelope
containing photos and letters,

742
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:43,560
the evidence of Mr Boddy's informants.

743
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:47,280
- Where's the envelope now?
- Gone.

744
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:52,440
Destroyed. Perhaps in the fire,
the only possible place.

745
01:17:54,720 --> 01:18:00,360
Aha...! Then the murderer
went to the cupboard,

746
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:02,600
unlocked it, took the wrench...

747
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:07,800
Then we found the passage to
the lounge and found the motorist dead.

748
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,640
That's right! We couldn't get in,
so we went back,

749
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:18,000
got the gun and shot the door open,
bang! And then the doorbell rang.

750
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:23,640
Whoever it is must go away
or they'll be killed.

751
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:29,720
Have you ever thought
about the Kingdom of Heaven?

752
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:33,800
- What?
- The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.

753
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:37,520
- You ain't kiddin'.
- Armageddon is almost upon us.

754
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:40,280
- It's already here!
- Go away!

755
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:45,680
- Your souls are in danger.
- Our lives are in danger, you beatnik!

756
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:51,520
The cop came, we put him in the library.
We forgot the open cupboard, split up.

757
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:54,960
And the murderer
switched off the electricity.

758
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:58,520
- Oh, my God!
- Turn on the lights!

759
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:05,560
- Didn't mean to frighten you.
- Bit late for that... I hate that!

760
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:10,840
Then came three more murders.
None of us killed Mr Boddy or the cook.

761
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,560
- So who did?!
- The one person who wasn't with us.

762
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,720
- Yvette.
- Yvette!

763
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:23,720
She was listening to us. She heard
the shot and thought he was dead.

764
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:28,520
While we examined the bullet-hole,
she got the dagger, ran to the kitchen,

765
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:34,320
and stabbed the cook. We heard nothing
because Mrs Peacock was screaming.

766
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:37,840
Yvette returned,
screamed and we ran to her.

767
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,000
- When did she kill Mr Boddy?
- When I said.

768
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:45,960
We ran to see the cook. Yvette
checked that Mr Boddy was dead.

769
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:51,960
He followed into the hall, she hit him on
the head and dragged him to the toilet.

770
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:54,360
- Why?
- To create confusion.

771
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:57,240
- It worked.
- Why did she do it?

772
01:19:57,400 --> 01:20:01,720
Was she obeying orders
from the person who later killed her?

773
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:03,280
- Who?
- Who?

774
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:05,320
Who?

775
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:09,360
Was it one of her clients?

776
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:14,440
Or was it a jealous wife?
Or an adulterous doctor?

777
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:19,120
- No, it was her employer, Miss Scarlet.
- That's a lie.

778
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:23,880
Is it? You used her
the way you always used her.

779
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:26,280
You killed the motorist.

780
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:30,320
- How did I know about the passage?
- Yvette told you.

781
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:36,120
When we split up again,
you switched off the electricity.

782
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:40,320
You got the lead pipe and the rope,
strangled Yvette,

783
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:45,720
ran to the library, killed the cop,
picked up the gun,

784
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:52,160
opened the door, recognised the singer
from her photo, and shot her.

785
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:55,640
- You've no proof.
- The gun is missing.

786
01:20:55,840 --> 01:21:00,080
Gentlemen, turn out your pockets.
Ladies, empty your purses.

787
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:02,880
Whoever has the gun is the murderer.

788
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,400
Brilliant! I congratulate you.

789
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:09,080
- Me too!
- Shut up!

790
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:12,280
- One thing I don't understand.
- One thing?

791
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:15,760
Why? Half of Washington
knows your business.

792
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:20,360
You were in no danger. The whole town
would be implicated with you.

793
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:25,200
They don't know
that my real business is secrets.

794
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:27,920
And Yvette found them out for me.

795
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:31,560
The secrets of Senator Peacock's
defence committee,

796
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:38,000
Colonel Mustard's fusion bomb,
Professor Plum's UN contacts,

797
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:43,600
and the work of your husband,
the nuclear physicist.

798
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:46,760
So, it is political. You're a Communist!

799
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:51,040
No, Mr Green.
Communism is just a red herring.

800
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:56,120
Like all prostitutes, I'm a capitalist
and I'm going to sell my secrets,

801
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:59,440
your secrets, to the highest bidder.

802
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:04,520
- What if we don't cooperate?
- You will, or I'll expose you.

803
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:10,760
- We could expose you. Six murders...
- It won't help your reputation at the UN.

804
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:15,760
You're implicated not only in adultery
with a patient but in her death.

805
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:21,800
- And the deaths of five others.
- You don't know the UN, it might help.

806
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:26,880
- It's no good, I've no more money.
- Neither do I.

807
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:32,600
I know. But you can pay me
in government information, all of you.

808
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:36,080
Except you, Wadsworth.

809
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:40,840
As a butler, you have no access
to government secrets.

810
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,240
So, I'm afraid your moment has come.

811
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:48,280
- Not so fast! I do have a secret or two.
- Such as?

812
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:51,440
Game's up.
There are no bullets in that gun.

813
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:54,880
- I'm not falling for that trick.
- It's no trick.

814
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:59,880
One for Boddy, two for the chandelier,
two at the door and one for the singer.

815
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:03,360
- That's not six.
- One plus two plus two plus one.

816
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:06,560
One for the chandelier.
One plus two plus one plus one.

817
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:12,160
That's one plus one plus two plus one.
Not one plus two plus one plus one.

818
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,680
One plus two plus... Shut up!

819
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:19,200
The point is, there's one bullet,
and guess who's gonna get it?

820
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:32,800
I'm only a guest!

821
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:37,240
Where's the Chief?

822
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,240
Well done, Wadsworth.

823
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:45,080
I warned you. Mr Hoover
is an expert on Armageddon.

824
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:48,320
Don't hate me for trying to shoot you.

825
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:53,600
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn.
There are no bullets in this gun.

826
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:01,600
One plus two... plus one...

827
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:04,840
Plus two, plus one... is...

828
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:22,600
In the dark,
the murderer ran to the study,

829
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:25,960
got the rope and lead pipe,
ran to the billiard-room,

830
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:28,840
strangled Yvette...

831
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:35,280
Ran to the library, hit the cop.
The doorbell, it was the singing telegram.

832
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:41,320
The murderer picked up the gun, ran
to the door, recognised and shot the girl.

833
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:44,640
- Then ran back to the cellar.
- The cellar!

834
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:50,840
- Colonel Mustard wasn't in the cellar!
- No... But you were!

835
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:53,080
So?

836
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:56,720
You were missing
when the cook and Mr Boddy died.

837
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:02,120
The cook used to be your cook.
Remember your fatal mistake?

838
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:06,160
You told us at dinner
we were eating your favourite dish.

839
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:09,680
Monkey's brains,
though popular in Cantonese cuisine,

840
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:12,400
are not often found in Washington DC.

841
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:14,680
Is that what we ate?

842
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:19,240
- Why murder the others?
- In case Mr Boddy'd told them of you.

843
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:24,000
It was nothing to do with a nuclear
physicist and the fusion bomb?

844
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:29,320
No, Communism was a red herring.
Mrs Peacock did it all.

845
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:33,240
- There's no proof.
- The gun is missing.

846
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:37,320
Gentlemen, turn out your pockets.
Ladies, empty your purses.

847
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:39,920
Whoever has the gun is the murderer.

848
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:41,560
Very well.

849
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:46,560
What do you propose to do about it?

850
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:48,840
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

851
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:53,920
Nothing. I don't approve of murder,
but you've done the world a service

852
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:57,720
by ridding it of a blackmailer
and his informers.

853
01:25:57,880 --> 01:26:02,400
- The police will be here any minute.
- Why? Nobody's called them.

854
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:05,640
- You mean...?
- That's right!

855
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:10,320
I suggest we stack the bodies
in the cellar, lock it,

856
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:15,720
leave quietly one at a time
and pretend none of this ever happened.

857
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:20,760
Great idea! I'll leave first,
if you don't mind.

858
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:26,960
Be my guest. In fact, I think
we all owe you a vote of thanks.

859
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:33,120
For she's a jolly good fellow
For she's a jolly good fellow

860
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:37,320
For she's a jolly good fellow

861
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:39,680
Which nobody can deny

862
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:44,160
Which nobody can deny
Which nobody can deny

863
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:48,560
For she's a jolly good fellow
For she's a jolly good fellow

864
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:50,600
For she's a jolly...

865
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:54,800
- I said I didn't do it!
- What if the authorities find out?

866
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,360
- The FBI will take care of that.
- You mean...

867
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:02,840
Mr Hoover? I work for him, of course.
How else could I know all about you?

868
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:06,760
- One thing I don't understand.
- One thing?

869
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:09,400
Who was bribing Mrs Peacock?

870
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:13,080
A foreign power.
Her husband handles defence contracts.

871
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:17,720
- Will there be a cover-up?
- Yes, what's to be gained by exposure?

872
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:20,720
Do the FBI clean up
after multiple murder?

873
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:25,080
Yes. Why do you think it's run
by a man called Hoover?

874
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:32,600
Mrs Peacock?

875
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:39,160
- How did you know my name?
- The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.

876
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:43,120
OK, take her away.

877
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:50,160
Take your hands off me.
I'm a Senator's wife!

878
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:52,880
Wadsworth, we got her.

879
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:56,880
See? Like the Mounties,
we always get our man.

880
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:59,440
Mrs Peacock was a man?

881
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:04,280
Would anyone care for fruit, or dessert?

882
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:20,520
- Didn't mean to frighten anyone.
- Bit late for that!

883
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:23,720
- Then three more murders.
- So who did it?!

884
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:27,240
Let's consider each murder one by one.

885
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:30,600
Professor Plum,
you knew Mr Boddy was still alive.

886
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:34,680
Even psychiatrists can tell
if patients are alive or dead.

887
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:39,320
You fired the gun in the dark, missed,
and pretended he was dead.

888
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:42,640
You were able to kill him later,
unobserved.

889
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:46,640
He was missing in the kitchen
when we found the cook.

890
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:51,760
He was with us when we found Yvette,
so how did he kill the cook?

891
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:54,880
- I didn't.
- Expect us to believe that?

892
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:59,040
I expect you to believe it.
You killed the cook.

893
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:02,840
She informed on you to Mr Boddy.
You made one mistake.

894
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:08,480
Sitting here, Mrs Peacock said she was
eating one of her favourite recipes.

895
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:12,600
And monkeys' brains,
though popular in Cantonese cuisine,

896
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:16,080
are not often found in Washington DC.

897
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:19,480
Colonel, when we saw the motorist
at the door,

898
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:24,160
you took the key to the cupboard
and suggested we split up.

899
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:27,040
You left Miss Scarlet,
crossed the hall,

900
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:30,560
opened the cupboard, took the wrench,

901
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:33,800
entered the lounge,
killed the motorist with a blow.

902
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:36,040
Like that!

903
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:42,560
- This is incredible!
- Not compared to what happened next.

904
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:45,960
I went upstairs with you, Mrs White.

905
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:49,680
And, while I was in the master bedroom,

906
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:53,440
you hurried downstairs,
turned off the electricity,

907
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:57,080
got the rope, and throttled Yvette.

908
01:29:57,240 --> 01:30:01,480
You were jealous of your husband
and Yvette so you killed him, too.

909
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:03,760
Yes.

910
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:08,680
Yes, I did it. I killed Yvette.

911
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:12,960
I hated her so much...

912
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:15,680
it, it... flames...

913
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:19,360
flames on the side of my face...

914
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:23,440
breathing, breath, heaving breaths...

915
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:28,280
While we were in the billiard-room,
Miss Scarlet crossed to the library,

916
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:32,080
and hit the cop she'd been bribing
with a lead pipe.

917
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:37,040
- True or false?
- True. Who are you? Perry Mason?

918
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:40,560
- Mr Green must have shot the singer.
- I didn't!

919
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:43,760
- There's nobody else left.
- I didn't do it.

920
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:47,920
The gun is missing.
Whoever's got the gun shot the girl.

921
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:50,360
- I shot her.
- You?!

922
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:54,920
I was going to expose you.

923
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:59,080
- I choose to expose myself.
- Please! Ladies present.

924
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:04,880
You thought Mr Boddy was dead. Why?
None of you had met him before.

925
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:07,840
You're Mr Boddy!

926
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,800
Wait!

927
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:12,240
- Who did I kill?
- My butler.

928
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,480
Oh, shucks.

929
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:18,000
He was expendable, like you.

930
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:21,680
I'm grateful to you
for disposing of my informers.

931
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:25,240
Saved me the trouble
of destroying the evidence.

932
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:29,280
This has nothing to do
with my nuclear physicist husband

933
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:32,960
or Colonel Mustard's work
with the fusion bomb?

934
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:36,080
No, Communism was just a red herring.

935
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:42,520
The police are coming.
You'll never get away with it.

936
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:45,520
Why should the police come?
Nobody's called them.

937
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:48,320
- You mean...
- Oh, my God! Of course!

938
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:52,320
Why shouldn't we escape?
Put the bodies in the cellar,

939
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:56,200
leave quietly and forget
any of this ever happened.

940
01:31:56,360 --> 01:32:01,440
- And you'll go on blackmailing us.
- Of course, why not?

941
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:04,000
Well, I'll tell you why not.

942
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:09,520
Good shot, Green.

943
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:22,920
Very good.

944
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:33,720
- You a cop?
- I'm a plant.

945
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:37,760
- A plant? Men like you are called fruits.
- Very funny.

946
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:41,360
FBI. That call from J Edgar Hoover
was for me.

947
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:46,440
I told you I didn't do it.

948
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:55,480
- All right. Who done it?
- He did it.

949
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:57,520
- That gentleman...
- No!

950
01:32:57,680 --> 01:32:59,880
They all did it.

951
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:04,760
But if you wanna know
who killed Mr Boddy, I did.

952
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:08,400
In the hall, with the revolver.

953
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:12,840
OK, Chief. Take 'em away.
I'm going home to sleep with my wife.
