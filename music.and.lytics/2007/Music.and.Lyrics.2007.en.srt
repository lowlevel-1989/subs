1
00:00:54,703 --> 00:00:58,639
I never thought
That I could be so satisfied

2
00:00:58,807 --> 00:01:02,334
Every time that I look in your angel eyes

3
00:01:02,511 --> 00:01:07,210
A shock inside me
That words just can't describe

4
00:01:07,382 --> 00:01:09,976
And there's no explaining

5
00:01:10,152 --> 00:01:13,883
Something in the way you move
I can't deny

6
00:01:14,056 --> 00:01:17,548
Every word from your lips is a lullaby

7
00:01:17,726 --> 00:01:20,320
A twist of fate makes life worthwhile

8
00:01:20,495 --> 00:01:23,089
You are gold and silver

9
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:27,993
I said I wasn't gonna lose my head

10
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,573
- But then pop goes my heart
- Pop goes my heart

11
00:01:32,741 --> 00:01:35,574
I wasn't gonna fall in love again

12
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:39,874
- But then pop goes my heart
- Pop goes my heart

13
00:01:40,048 --> 00:01:45,008
And I just can't let you go

14
00:01:45,187 --> 00:01:48,020
I can't lose this feeling

15
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,852
These precious moments
We have so few

16
00:01:51,026 --> 00:01:55,622
Let's go far away
Where there's nothing to do but play

17
00:01:55,797 --> 00:02:00,359
You've shown to me
That my destiny's with you

18
00:02:00,535 --> 00:02:02,799
And there's no explaining

19
00:02:03,572 --> 00:02:06,132
I said I wasn't gonna lose my head

20
00:02:06,308 --> 00:02:10,972
- But then pop goes my heart
- Pop goes my heart

21
00:02:11,146 --> 00:02:13,774
I wasn't gonna fall in love again

22
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:17,612
- But then pop goes my heart
- Pop goes my heart

23
00:02:17,786 --> 00:02:22,985
And I just can't let you go

24
00:02:23,158 --> 00:02:26,286
I can't lose this feeling

25
00:02:38,306 --> 00:02:40,570
A twist of fate makes life worthwhile

26
00:02:40,742 --> 00:02:45,179
You are gold and silver

27
00:02:45,347 --> 00:02:48,180
I said I wasn't gonna lose my head

28
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:52,684
- But then pop goes my heart
- Pop goes my heart

29
00:02:52,854 --> 00:02:56,312
I wasn't gonna fall in love again

30
00:02:56,491 --> 00:02:59,688
- But then pop goes my heart
- Pop goes my heart

31
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:01,089
And I just

32
00:03:01,363 --> 00:03:06,198
Can't let you go

33
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,836
PoP was one of the biggest bands
of the '80s...

34
00:03:11,006 --> 00:03:13,600
...but today they're known
as Colin Thompson's old group.

35
00:03:13,775 --> 00:03:16,767
Colin, or as he's been dubbed
by the queen, "Sir Colin"...

36
00:03:16,945 --> 00:03:20,278
...has gone on to sell millions of records,
star in blockbuster films...

37
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:23,145
...and create his own cologne,
"A Whiff of Colin."

38
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:24,580
But here's a question:

39
00:03:24,753 --> 00:03:28,120
Can you remember the name
of the other guy in PoP?

40
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,282
Whatever happened to Alex Fletcher?

41
00:03:31,893 --> 00:03:35,886
Tonight we find out
on Battle of the '80s Has-Beens.

42
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:40,601
We think it's gonna be bigger
than American Idol.

43
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:42,236
So, what do you think, Alex?

44
00:03:42,404 --> 00:03:43,530
Well, I love it.

45
00:03:43,705 --> 00:03:47,641
It's brilliant on so many levels,
I don't even know where to start.

46
00:03:47,809 --> 00:03:48,798
Good for you.

47
00:03:48,977 --> 00:03:51,104
Because some of the people
we've approached...

48
00:03:51,279 --> 00:03:55,147
...have had a little problem
with the term "has-been."

49
00:03:55,317 --> 00:03:56,306
Have they? Have they?

50
00:03:56,485 --> 00:04:00,854
You see, I don't share that.
I am a happy has-been. Really.

51
00:04:01,022 --> 00:04:03,252
It's a very clear statement:
"I live in the past.

52
00:04:03,425 --> 00:04:05,325
Everything good I ever did
was long ago.

53
00:04:05,494 --> 00:04:07,826
Don't expect anything
new or exciting from me now."

54
00:04:07,996 --> 00:04:10,863
Really takes the pressure off.
Especially on a first date.

55
00:04:11,032 --> 00:04:12,397
Good for you.

56
00:04:13,235 --> 00:04:15,601
So we've already taped several shows...

57
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,034
...and we're going to start
airing them this week.

58
00:04:18,206 --> 00:04:20,868
And some of the performers
include REO Speedwagon...

59
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:22,873
- Speedwagon.
- ...Flock of Seagulls...

60
00:04:23,044 --> 00:04:24,204
The Flock? Okay.

61
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:26,108
- ...Debbie Gibson, Tiffany...
- Debbie.

62
00:04:27,115 --> 00:04:30,346
- History there.
- ...and Frankie Goes to Hollywood.

63
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:33,454
So "Relax."

64
00:04:33,989 --> 00:04:35,889
Nice one.

65
00:04:36,057 --> 00:04:38,617
Good. Okay. Worthy adversaries, all.

66
00:04:38,793 --> 00:04:41,489
And how many songs
would I actually get to perform?

67
00:04:41,663 --> 00:04:43,290
I'd like to do two, you know?

68
00:04:43,465 --> 00:04:45,695
A ballad and then maybe
a more up-tempo number...

69
00:04:45,867 --> 00:04:48,358
...where I get to shake it a bit.

70
00:04:48,537 --> 00:04:53,099
I can't promise any of the acts
that they'll be singing.

71
00:04:53,808 --> 00:04:57,744
Sorry? Confused.
What would we be doing, then?

72
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,907
Boxing.

73
00:05:01,383 --> 00:05:05,615
That's why the show is called
Battle of the '80s Has-Beens.

74
00:05:05,787 --> 00:05:09,814
Only the winner gets to sing.

75
00:05:16,665 --> 00:05:19,327
Right, right, right. Got you.

76
00:05:25,373 --> 00:05:27,170
- Afternoon, Mr. Fletcher.
- Hello, Willy.

77
00:05:27,342 --> 00:05:28,331
Have a good day.

78
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,444
Yes, well, enjoyed it so far.

79
00:05:31,746 --> 00:05:34,237
- All right. There he is.
- Oh, my manager.

80
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:37,112
All right, listen,
I had no idea they meant boxing.

81
00:05:37,285 --> 00:05:39,082
Nobody said a word to me, I swear.

82
00:05:39,254 --> 00:05:42,189
No, it's not a problem.
I can definitely take Flock of Seagulls.

83
00:05:42,357 --> 00:05:46,350
We did a tour with them in '89 and we beat
them severely. They cried like little girls.

84
00:05:46,528 --> 00:05:50,123
All right, listen. It's my fault
and I hate myself for it, but I'm not upset.

85
00:05:50,298 --> 00:05:51,959
And do you know why?

86
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:53,657
You've been at my liquor.

87
00:05:53,835 --> 00:05:55,132
Because of her.

88
00:05:56,838 --> 00:05:59,136
Cora Corman.
Biggest star in the world.

89
00:05:59,307 --> 00:06:01,673
Bigger than Britney and Christina
put together.

90
00:06:01,843 --> 00:06:05,108
And guess who she loves.

91
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,372
Her country?

92
00:06:07,249 --> 00:06:12,551
You. She's a huge PoP fan
and she wants to meet you, Alex.

93
00:06:12,721 --> 00:06:14,655
Hang on, hang on.

94
00:06:16,658 --> 00:06:17,647
Khan, I've missed you.

95
00:06:17,826 --> 00:06:19,851
Alex, I have Sophie here for you.

96
00:06:20,028 --> 00:06:21,620
That sounds like fun. Who is she?

97
00:06:21,796 --> 00:06:24,094
She's here to do your plants.

98
00:06:24,266 --> 00:06:25,426
But Jane does my plants.

99
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,468
She can be in and out in five minutes,
and this is really the best time for her.

100
00:06:29,638 --> 00:06:31,833
It seems she cannot be stopped.
Send her up.

101
00:06:32,507 --> 00:06:34,634
So start again. Cora Corman...

102
00:06:34,809 --> 00:06:37,835
Why do you have a plant lady?
Why do you even have plants?

103
00:06:38,413 --> 00:06:40,313
Because from time to time...

104
00:06:40,482 --> 00:06:42,609
...ladies accompany me
back to the apartment...

105
00:06:42,784 --> 00:06:45,582
...and one once mentioned
that plants make women comfortable.

106
00:06:45,754 --> 00:06:48,587
Is that true?
Plants make women comfortable?

107
00:06:48,757 --> 00:06:51,590
Well, maybe if I had plants
I'd still be married.

108
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,421
Yes, I think that was the problem.

109
00:06:53,595 --> 00:06:55,586
Not Susan's affair
and raging nymphomania...

110
00:06:55,764 --> 00:06:57,698
...but your lack of vegetation.

111
00:06:59,301 --> 00:07:00,700
Hang on.

112
00:07:05,907 --> 00:07:08,671
- Hi, I'm Sophie Fisher.
- I'm Alex Fletcher.

113
00:07:08,843 --> 00:07:12,040
- You didn't get the message from Jane?
- No. I haven't listened to my--

114
00:07:12,213 --> 00:07:14,773
She was supposed to let you know
I'd be doing plants.

115
00:07:15,317 --> 00:07:17,478
Very nice. Lovely. Well, come on in.

116
00:07:17,652 --> 00:07:18,710
Thank you.

117
00:07:18,887 --> 00:07:22,823
I hope you have your own watering can.
Jane told me that everyone had their own.

118
00:07:22,991 --> 00:07:27,121
But this last guy, Mr. Werther, about 80,
he didn't have his own watering can...

119
00:07:27,295 --> 00:07:30,264
...so he starts yelling at me
and screaming at me in German:

120
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,868
I'm fluent enough
to know what he's saying.

121
00:07:34,035 --> 00:07:36,970
You haven't been cursed at
till you've been cursed at in German.

122
00:07:37,138 --> 00:07:39,299
I know what you mean.
I dated a frÃ¤ulein once.

123
00:07:40,241 --> 00:07:44,200
Plant stuff is in the kitchen under the sink.
And I have my own can.

124
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:46,643
Oh, well, vielen Dank.

125
00:07:47,115 --> 00:07:49,777
Hi, I'm Chris Riley, Alex's manager.

126
00:07:49,951 --> 00:07:52,920
Oh, Sophie Fisher. Nice to meet you.

127
00:07:54,255 --> 00:07:56,587
So kitchen?

128
00:07:56,758 --> 00:07:58,953
- Yeah.
- Great.

129
00:08:00,195 --> 00:08:02,891
So Cora Corman, huh?
How great is that? Do you believe it?

130
00:08:03,064 --> 00:08:06,591
All right, wait, wait, wait.
Is it even a good idea? Pros and cons.

131
00:08:06,768 --> 00:08:11,467
Pros: She's a huge star,
great publicity, terrific money.

132
00:08:12,474 --> 00:08:13,634
Cons?

133
00:08:13,808 --> 00:08:16,436
No matter what you do,
in 40 years we'll both be dead.

134
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:20,274
Okay. Huge star, great publicity,
terrific money versus eventual death.

135
00:08:20,448 --> 00:08:22,075
I think we have to think about it.

136
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,650
Okay, good, because Cora
is shooting a video tonight.

137
00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:27,287
- She wants to meet both of us right after.
- Tonight?

138
00:08:27,455 --> 00:08:28,649
- Tonight?
- Yes, tonight.

139
00:08:30,825 --> 00:08:32,383
You all right?

140
00:08:33,228 --> 00:08:36,026
Do you have a Band-Aid
and antibiotic cream?

141
00:08:36,197 --> 00:08:40,031
No, no. And sadly,
I think I've lent out my iron lung.

142
00:08:40,201 --> 00:08:41,293
Okay.

143
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:44,836
Well, then I'm gonna go because,
you know, this could get infected.

144
00:08:45,006 --> 00:08:48,806
And it's not clotting yet, but, I mean,
I'm a little hypochondriacal.

145
00:08:48,977 --> 00:08:51,605
You just-- You can never be too careful.

146
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,975
Anyway, I'll come back and finish.

147
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:56,982
So come again. I mean, you live here.
I'll come again.

148
00:08:57,152 --> 00:08:58,642
I'm gonna go get this looked at.

149
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:02,688
You should really have a first-aid kit.
Thank you. Have a good night. I'll see you.

150
00:09:05,593 --> 00:09:06,753
Weird.

151
00:09:06,928 --> 00:09:09,556
- Don't give her a key.
- No.

152
00:09:09,731 --> 00:09:11,460
So you said something about tonight.

153
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:13,624
Tonight we meet Cora.

154
00:09:19,207 --> 00:09:21,437
I've got to have my Buddha's delight

155
00:09:21,609 --> 00:09:24,203
Om shanti, shanti

156
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:26,404
I've got to have my Buddha's delight

157
00:09:26,581 --> 00:09:29,379
Om shanti, shanti

158
00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:32,081
I want a revelation

159
00:09:33,188 --> 00:09:34,883
And sweet salvation

160
00:09:35,056 --> 00:09:37,047
And the eternal fire

161
00:09:37,225 --> 00:09:39,523
Show me the eternal fire

162
00:09:41,229 --> 00:09:43,356
Like sitting meditation

163
00:09:43,898 --> 00:09:46,128
You give me elevation
Can you take me higher?

164
00:09:46,301 --> 00:09:48,735
She seems like a very spiritual kid.

165
00:09:48,903 --> 00:09:52,100
Yeah. It's nice to see
a young woman exploring religion.

166
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,049
I'm not satisfied if I don't get

167
00:10:03,218 --> 00:10:06,016
My Buddha's delight

168
00:10:10,191 --> 00:10:11,385
And cut.

169
00:10:12,894 --> 00:10:14,486
Terrific.

170
00:10:16,097 --> 00:10:18,122
- Hey, I'm Ray, Cora's manager.
- Chris Riley.

171
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:19,823
- Nice to meet you.
- Alex Fletcher.

172
00:10:20,001 --> 00:10:21,434
- Great to meet you.
- Hi, Ray...?

173
00:10:21,603 --> 00:10:24,663
Just Ray. Cora's this way, come on.
Follow me.

174
00:10:27,075 --> 00:10:30,044
C, this is Alex Fletcher
and his manager, Chris Riley.

175
00:10:30,211 --> 00:10:33,305
- We loved the video. It was unbelievable.
- Yeah.

176
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:36,917
You know, I wish I brought my daughter.
She worships you.

177
00:10:37,085 --> 00:10:40,213
I'm divorced. But that's another story.

178
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,718
Mr. Fletcher, it's a pleasure.

179
00:10:47,295 --> 00:10:51,664
Your song "Dance With Me Tonight" got me
through my parents' divorce when I was 7.

180
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:52,959
Really? Wow.

181
00:10:53,134 --> 00:10:56,103
Yeah, because I recorded that
when I was 9, so... Yeah.

182
00:10:56,271 --> 00:11:00,571
I want my fans to know the same
spiritual uplift that your music gave me.

183
00:11:00,742 --> 00:11:04,109
That would be lovely. I have a few tunes
it would be nice to update.

184
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:07,874
Oh, I don't live in the past, Mr. Fletcher.
It was so long ago.

185
00:11:08,049 --> 00:11:10,017
I want you to write a new song.

186
00:11:11,052 --> 00:11:12,314
- Okay.
- You see...

187
00:11:12,487 --> 00:11:14,455
...I recently broke up with my boyfriend.

188
00:11:14,622 --> 00:11:17,455
We had been together
for almost two months.

189
00:11:18,026 --> 00:11:19,687
It was a terrible experience.

190
00:11:19,861 --> 00:11:23,797
But then I read a book by Guru Mathashavi
called A Way Back Into Love.

191
00:11:24,532 --> 00:11:26,796
And that will be the title
of our new song.

192
00:11:26,968 --> 00:11:29,903
And in two weeks when I open my tour
at Madison Square Garden...

193
00:11:30,071 --> 00:11:31,595
...we'll perform it together.

194
00:11:31,773 --> 00:11:32,967
Okay. Here's the snag--

195
00:11:33,141 --> 00:11:35,109
We also wanna put the song
on her new CD...

196
00:11:35,276 --> 00:11:38,040
...which is pretty much finished,
so we need it by Friday.

197
00:11:38,212 --> 00:11:40,544
- This Friday?
- Yeah, but don't feel any pressure.

198
00:11:40,715 --> 00:11:44,207
We've got seven other retro artists
working on "Way Back Into Love"...

199
00:11:44,385 --> 00:11:46,546
...so if you blow it, we're covered.

200
00:11:46,721 --> 00:11:49,884
Mr. Fletcher,
don't look at this as a competition.

201
00:11:50,058 --> 00:11:52,856
If it's meant to be, it will be.

202
00:11:53,027 --> 00:11:54,494
It's destiny.

203
00:11:54,662 --> 00:11:55,686
Yes.

204
00:11:55,863 --> 00:11:57,387
Or not.

205
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,796
Okay.

206
00:12:03,972 --> 00:12:07,237
I can't possibly write a song by Friday.
What could she be thinking of?

207
00:12:07,408 --> 00:12:09,569
All right. Look, look,
can I be honest with you?

208
00:12:09,744 --> 00:12:11,871
You're my manager.
I would have to fire you.

209
00:12:12,046 --> 00:12:13,638
We need this.

210
00:12:13,815 --> 00:12:17,012
Let's not be desperate.
We have the state fairs, Knott's Berry Farm.

211
00:12:17,185 --> 00:12:18,174
They've canceled.

212
00:12:20,855 --> 00:12:22,516
Knott's Berry canceled?

213
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:26,393
Look. We're still on
for the Indiana State Fair, okay?

214
00:12:26,561 --> 00:12:29,394
But Texas and Arkansas dropped us.

215
00:12:29,564 --> 00:12:32,260
- The Apple Picking?
- The Apple Picking Festival is a go...

216
00:12:32,433 --> 00:12:36,096
...but Great Adventure only wants
three nights instead of 10. All right?

217
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:39,296
My God. I had no idea.
Why didn't you tell me these things? Why--?

218
00:12:39,474 --> 00:12:41,339
I'm telling-- I'm telling you now.

219
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:44,410
Alex, it's been 15 years since PoP.

220
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:47,309
There's new old acts
coming up all the time.

221
00:12:47,482 --> 00:12:51,316
Tears for Fears is going on tour.
There's talk of a Spice Girl reunion.

222
00:12:51,486 --> 00:12:53,283
- That's not my audience.
- Ricky Martin.

223
00:12:53,454 --> 00:12:56,082
I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead.
I'm finished. I'm finished.

224
00:12:56,257 --> 00:12:59,021
- No, you're not dead.
- I'm gonna wind up doing bar mitzvahs.

225
00:12:59,193 --> 00:13:03,027
No, you're not. Thirteen-year-old kids
have no idea who you are.

226
00:13:03,197 --> 00:13:04,391
Well, that's good to know.

227
00:13:04,565 --> 00:13:07,591
What about you? You might actually
have to take on another client.

228
00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:11,830
Look, don't worry about me. What we gotta
concentrate on is refreshing your image.

229
00:13:12,006 --> 00:13:15,305
Then we'll get Knott's Berry
and Great Adventure. Who knows?

230
00:13:15,476 --> 00:13:18,809
- We might even get Disneyland.
- Don't tease me. I'm very vulnerable.

231
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,312
Tell you something, Alex.
You do a song for Cora...

232
00:13:21,482 --> 00:13:24,576
...and there is a spot for you
in the Magic Kingdom, baby.

233
00:13:24,752 --> 00:13:28,051
Writing a song. I thought I was done
with that whole nightmare.

234
00:13:28,222 --> 00:13:30,747
Just one song.
That's all we need. One song.

235
00:13:31,225 --> 00:13:32,954
But it's so...

236
00:13:33,995 --> 00:13:35,485
...time-consuming, you know?

237
00:13:37,665 --> 00:13:39,633
And I haven't written for 10 years.

238
00:13:39,801 --> 00:13:43,237
And I need a lyricist. And it's never worked
with anyone except Colin.

239
00:13:43,404 --> 00:13:46,305
Look, I know it's not easy
to get somebody good this fast...

240
00:13:46,474 --> 00:13:49,534
...but there is this guy.
Supposedly he's very hip, very edgy.

241
00:13:49,711 --> 00:13:51,872
He just worked with Avril.

242
00:13:57,251 --> 00:13:59,845
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm just a bit blocked here.

243
00:14:00,021 --> 00:14:02,387
If you don't like the lyrics,
be straight with me.

244
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:05,415
No, no, no, no.
The lyrics are very, very powerful.

245
00:14:05,827 --> 00:14:09,456
Maybe you want something
more commercial? More PoP-y?

246
00:14:10,264 --> 00:14:12,994
Just hold that thinly veiled insult
for one second.

247
00:14:18,673 --> 00:14:20,197
- Hello.
- Hey.

248
00:14:20,374 --> 00:14:23,775
- Khan said I could just come up?
- They were able to save the whole hand.

249
00:14:23,945 --> 00:14:27,005
I know. I made too big a deal out of it.

250
00:14:27,181 --> 00:14:30,446
It's just that I hate infections.
But then again, who likes them?

251
00:14:30,618 --> 00:14:33,985
- Maybe the people who make penicillin.
- There's two sides to every story.

252
00:14:34,155 --> 00:14:37,955
True. Except for the Nazis. I can't really see
the other side of that argument.

253
00:14:38,126 --> 00:14:39,423
Excuse me?

254
00:14:39,594 --> 00:14:42,529
I'm sorry. I didn't even see you there.
Hi. I'm Sophie Fisher.

255
00:14:42,697 --> 00:14:46,224
Yeah, Sophie, this is Greg Antonsky.
He's a noted lyricist.

256
00:14:46,801 --> 00:14:52,000
Really? Well, I don't wanna get in your way.
And I can see that I already have.

257
00:14:52,173 --> 00:14:55,836
So I'm off to the kitchen. Don't tell me.

258
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,534
She's kind of hot.

259
00:14:57,712 --> 00:15:00,237
Good. Yeah. I'm glad you enjoyed her.

260
00:15:01,249 --> 00:15:02,910
She's coming back in here, right?

261
00:15:03,084 --> 00:15:06,417
I would imagine so. Unless she goes
directly back to the mother ship.

262
00:15:07,021 --> 00:15:08,852
How about:

263
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,157
Give it up, I'm a bad hot witch

264
00:15:12,326 --> 00:15:14,988
I look real good, but I'm a nasty bitch

265
00:15:15,163 --> 00:15:18,223
I can scream and claw
And curdle your blood

266
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,836
But you'll die on your way back into love

267
00:15:23,838 --> 00:15:26,830
No. Start on a minor third. Try that.

268
00:15:27,008 --> 00:15:29,476
Right. So:

269
00:15:29,644 --> 00:15:32,238
Give it up, I'm a bad hot witch

270
00:15:32,413 --> 00:15:34,108
I look real good, but I'm a nasty--

271
00:15:34,282 --> 00:15:35,977
Come on. You're missing the point.

272
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:40,177
From the first line.
"Give it up, I'm a bad hot witch" is okay.

273
00:15:40,354 --> 00:15:41,651
But then it should be--

274
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:45,884
But with some magic, I just might switch

275
00:15:51,365 --> 00:15:52,855
Sorry. What did you say?

276
00:15:55,102 --> 00:15:57,093
I don't remember.

277
00:15:57,538 --> 00:16:01,406
I think it was,
"But with some magic, I just might switch."

278
00:16:01,576 --> 00:16:04,272
- That is actually quite intriguing.
- That's not my lyric.

279
00:16:04,445 --> 00:16:06,174
No, I know, but it's a lovely phrase.

280
00:16:06,347 --> 00:16:09,111
Look, if you can't handle anything
except moon and June...

281
00:16:09,283 --> 00:16:13,117
...why don't we just let
plant girl finish the lyrics?

282
00:16:13,287 --> 00:16:14,549
Plant girl.

283
00:16:14,722 --> 00:16:17,316
Give it up, I'm a bad hot witch

284
00:16:17,491 --> 00:16:19,721
But with some magic, I just might switch

285
00:16:19,894 --> 00:16:23,694
- Finish it.
- I'm just here to cater to the plants.

286
00:16:23,865 --> 00:16:25,958
And you are doing a fine job,
if I may say so.

287
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:27,725
Although that one is plastic.

288
00:16:30,338 --> 00:16:31,566
This is a waste of time.

289
00:16:32,974 --> 00:16:35,499
Let's fly my broom to the stars above

290
00:16:35,676 --> 00:16:39,510
And we'll charm our way back into love

291
00:16:43,751 --> 00:16:47,983
What's the next line,
"Feelings, nothing more than feelings"?

292
00:16:48,956 --> 00:16:50,617
You people disgust me.

293
00:16:53,961 --> 00:16:57,294
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have gotten involved.
I have no filtering system.

294
00:16:57,465 --> 00:16:58,830
No. That's fine, that's fine.

295
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,400
He had to get back to his job
at Hallmark anyway.

296
00:17:01,569 --> 00:17:04,003
Listen, have you ever done any writing?

297
00:17:04,171 --> 00:17:07,368
I mean, everybody's done some writing,
you know? Well, not everybody.

298
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,771
Illiteracy is a growing epidemic
in this country.

299
00:17:09,944 --> 00:17:11,468
I write slogans for Weight-Not...

300
00:17:11,646 --> 00:17:14,342
...this weight reduction company
that my sister runs.

301
00:17:14,515 --> 00:17:16,847
Did you ever hear of the band PoP?

302
00:17:17,018 --> 00:17:21,011
Yeah, of course, everybody has.
My sister Rhonda loved them.

303
00:17:21,188 --> 00:17:24,214
They had that ridiculous hair
and those ridiculous outfits and--

304
00:17:24,392 --> 00:17:25,882
Oh, my God, you're one of them.

305
00:17:27,328 --> 00:17:29,159
That hair was very much in style then.

306
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,298
- I'm very sorry.
- Yeah, that's fine.

307
00:17:31,465 --> 00:17:34,559
But I would love to talk to you
about maybe writing some lyrics.

308
00:17:34,969 --> 00:17:36,129
But I don't write lyrics.

309
00:17:36,304 --> 00:17:39,330
Well, we could just kick some ideas around,
repot the ficus.

310
00:17:39,507 --> 00:17:41,805
I don't think so.
I appreciate the offer, though.

311
00:17:41,976 --> 00:17:44,638
I have to go babysit for my sister now.
I mean, her kids.

312
00:17:44,812 --> 00:17:48,441
She's 38 now, so... Thank you.

313
00:17:50,952 --> 00:17:52,977
Okay, listen.
Do you know who Cora Corman is?

314
00:17:53,154 --> 00:17:54,781
Oh, yeah. My niece loves her.

315
00:17:54,956 --> 00:17:58,153
Okay, well, I'm writing a song for her,
so if you change your mind...

316
00:17:58,326 --> 00:18:02,262
...and the idea of working with me is
of any interest at all, please just call, okay?

317
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:05,866
Or if you just fancy a good laugh,
I am performing at the Hilton tonight.

318
00:18:06,033 --> 00:18:09,400
Well, thank you.
I mean, but I can't, you know. I'm sorry.

319
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:12,562
"I just can't," she says mysteriously.
But I just can't.

320
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,174
- I'm sorry. Thank you for the offer.
- Yes.

321
00:18:19,914 --> 00:18:22,007
Oh, my God.

322
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,777
Go to the next level, weirdo.

323
00:18:24,952 --> 00:18:27,318
You have to go to the next level.

324
00:18:27,888 --> 00:18:31,085
It's your parents. Go get into bed.
Get into bed. This is not a drill.

325
00:18:31,258 --> 00:18:35,024
- But we haven't even brushed our teeth.
- Get in there. Get in there. Get into bed.

326
00:18:35,796 --> 00:18:37,195
- Hey.
- Hi.

327
00:18:37,365 --> 00:18:39,196
- How was the movie?
- I enjoyed it.

328
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:41,198
- He fell asleep.
- I enjoy sleeping.

329
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:43,098
- How was dinner?
- Really nice place.

330
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,330
It's really hard to enjoy dinner
when you run a weight-loss center.

331
00:18:46,507 --> 00:18:49,476
- If I get fat, there goes my fiscal year.
- Honey, you're not fat.

332
00:18:49,643 --> 00:18:52,669
You're not about to open a branch in Boca.
But thank you, sweetie.

333
00:18:52,847 --> 00:18:55,111
- How'd everything go here?
- Oh, yeah. Good. Great.

334
00:18:55,282 --> 00:18:57,716
The kids ate and went to sleep.

335
00:18:59,787 --> 00:19:02,950
Yeah, it-- They're really bad children.

336
00:19:03,391 --> 00:19:06,849
Okay, okay. Everybody goes to bed.
I'm sending your father in there.

337
00:19:07,028 --> 00:19:11,226
Whoa, we're so scared.

338
00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:13,765
And then I'm coming in.

339
00:19:15,336 --> 00:19:17,930
I'll just go check
to make sure they're still breathing.

340
00:19:18,773 --> 00:19:21,799
Hey, wanna do some stress eating?
Just a piece of diet cheesecake.

341
00:19:21,976 --> 00:19:25,241
This thing happened to me today--
I don't know. I'm just gonna go home.

342
00:19:25,413 --> 00:19:26,607
You seem so jumpy tonight.

343
00:19:26,781 --> 00:19:29,249
You know, I feel a little guilty
about something.

344
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:30,577
How unusual for you.

345
00:19:31,052 --> 00:19:32,644
Okay, listen. I have to tell you.

346
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,847
I met that guy from that band
you used to like. Alex Fletcher from PoP?

347
00:19:37,024 --> 00:19:38,082
Oh, my God.

348
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:41,786
Anyway, I do Jane's plant service.
I'm taking over for her while she's gone.

349
00:19:41,962 --> 00:19:44,487
And anyway, she does his apartment,
so I was there.

350
00:19:44,665 --> 00:19:46,189
Actually, it was the second time.

351
00:19:46,367 --> 00:19:48,733
And he invited me
to come see him perform tonight.

352
00:19:48,903 --> 00:19:50,700
Gary, I'm going out!

353
00:19:50,871 --> 00:19:55,001
Oh, my God. I love him. I love him.
I love him. I love him.

354
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:59,275
- That really wasn't the end of the story.
- Come on. Help me dress.

355
00:19:59,447 --> 00:20:01,779
Should I wear the red one?

356
00:20:24,305 --> 00:20:27,399
I saw you across the dance floor

357
00:20:27,575 --> 00:20:30,476
Out of the corner of my eye

358
00:20:31,011 --> 00:20:33,036
I felt a connection

359
00:20:33,214 --> 00:20:36,843
I don't know how, I don't know why

360
00:20:37,017 --> 00:20:40,009
I shouldn't have stayed
When I saw you there

361
00:20:40,187 --> 00:20:42,382
With another man

362
00:20:42,556 --> 00:20:45,855
But as we slipped away
I thought I heard you say:

363
00:20:46,026 --> 00:20:49,154
"This wasn't part of the plan"

364
00:20:51,065 --> 00:20:52,896
Just a meaningless kiss

365
00:20:53,434 --> 00:20:57,029
It wasn't supposed to end up like this

366
00:20:57,204 --> 00:20:58,899
Just a meaningless kiss

367
00:21:03,077 --> 00:21:05,443
Just a meaningless kiss

368
00:21:05,613 --> 00:21:08,878
We knew it was wrong
But we couldn't resist

369
00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:11,040
Just a meaningless kiss

370
00:21:11,218 --> 00:21:15,712
'Til I fell in love with you

371
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:18,415
Girls, tell me the truth.
Are these pants too tight?

372
00:21:21,328 --> 00:21:23,023
Oh, my God, I gotta get up there.

373
00:21:23,197 --> 00:21:24,892
And here we are two years later

374
00:21:25,065 --> 00:21:27,465
Too late to turn back now

375
00:21:27,635 --> 00:21:30,570
We've gotta finish
What we shouldn't have started

376
00:21:30,738 --> 00:21:33,764
We gotta walk away somehow

377
00:21:33,941 --> 00:21:36,842
But it's easier said than done

378
00:21:37,011 --> 00:21:39,241
When two hearts beat as one

379
00:21:40,014 --> 00:21:42,539
And three hearts are one too many

380
00:21:42,716 --> 00:21:45,116
That's why we shouldn't have ever begun

381
00:21:48,222 --> 00:21:50,053
Just a meaningless kiss

382
00:21:50,224 --> 00:21:53,955
We knew it was wrong
But we couldn't resist

383
00:21:54,128 --> 00:21:55,789
Just a meaningless kiss

384
00:21:55,963 --> 00:22:00,627
'Til I fell in love with you

385
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:14,579
We can't go on like this forever

386
00:22:14,748 --> 00:22:17,478
When we're not meant to be together

387
00:22:17,651 --> 00:22:20,620
So leave me here on my own

388
00:22:20,788 --> 00:22:24,622
From now on I guess
I've gotta dance alone

389
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,888
It wasn't supposed to end up like this

390
00:22:43,444 --> 00:22:45,674
- Alex!
- Alex!

391
00:22:45,846 --> 00:22:47,370
- Hello, girls.
- Alex, I'm Barbara.

392
00:22:47,548 --> 00:22:49,846
In Boston, in 1989,
I came back to your hotel...

393
00:22:50,017 --> 00:22:53,453
If you wanna see Alex again,
check his website for the tour schedule.

394
00:22:53,621 --> 00:22:57,455
And the Knott's Berry Farm show
is temporarily postponed, okay?

395
00:22:57,625 --> 00:23:00,822
Great show, huh? They love you.
They're hot for you.

396
00:23:00,995 --> 00:23:04,328
Of course, they're also hot because
so many are going through menopause.

397
00:23:04,498 --> 00:23:08,764
Wait a minute.
Barbara from Boston. From Boston.

398
00:23:08,936 --> 00:23:11,871
I do remember that Barbara. I do.
I'm going back for one second.

399
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:15,031
No. That's how we wind up
getting chased by angry husbands.

400
00:23:15,209 --> 00:23:17,268
- Not necessarily. She--
- Hi.

401
00:23:17,444 --> 00:23:18,809
Well, hi.

402
00:23:18,979 --> 00:23:22,415
Hello. Hello, hello. Very good news. Yes.

403
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:23,914
Chris, you remember Sophie?

404
00:23:24,084 --> 00:23:26,075
Planted in my memory.

405
00:23:27,154 --> 00:23:30,749
I just wanted to apologize
for being so cryptic earlier.

406
00:23:30,924 --> 00:23:33,586
- This is my sister, Rhonda.
- Hi.

407
00:23:34,295 --> 00:23:39,198
I'm sorry. I've--
You were so great tonight.

408
00:23:39,366 --> 00:23:42,301
We've met, haven't we? Right?
We were practically a duet there.

409
00:23:42,469 --> 00:23:44,562
I know. Anyway,
could I get a quick autograph?

410
00:23:44,738 --> 00:23:46,103
You may, Rhonda.

411
00:23:46,273 --> 00:23:48,764
- Could I get a picture too?
- Only if you're single.

412
00:23:48,942 --> 00:23:51,672
I've been married 16 years,
but nothing's written in stone.

413
00:23:51,845 --> 00:23:53,176
Could you scootch? Thanks.

414
00:23:53,347 --> 00:23:55,747
Also, I really wanted to thank you
for your offer.

415
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:58,384
- What offer?
- While Greg, the rhyming psychopath--

416
00:23:58,552 --> 00:23:59,610
Thanks again for him.

417
00:23:59,787 --> 00:24:03,052
--was in my apartment, Sophie spouted
some really interesting lyrics.

418
00:24:03,223 --> 00:24:04,713
I thought she was doing plants.

419
00:24:04,892 --> 00:24:06,189
I'm holding a pose here.

420
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,521
- I appreciate it--
- I need a song by Friday...

421
00:24:08,696 --> 00:24:11,529
...and it is amazingly difficult
to find a sane lyricist.

422
00:24:11,699 --> 00:24:13,792
Why don't you just
write the lyrics yourself?

423
00:24:13,967 --> 00:24:16,902
- That's really not a strength of his.
- That's absolutely right.

424
00:24:17,071 --> 00:24:19,096
I once rhymed "you and me"
with "autopsy."

425
00:24:19,273 --> 00:24:20,934
Well, that's not necessarily bad.

426
00:24:21,108 --> 00:24:23,167
You could do something with that.
You know?

427
00:24:23,344 --> 00:24:28,111
Figuring out you and me
Is like doing a love autopsy

428
00:24:28,282 --> 00:24:31,445
- You see, you see. That's quite good.
- That's not bad.

429
00:24:31,618 --> 00:24:35,679
- Go on. More. How does it go?
- I have no idea.

430
00:24:35,856 --> 00:24:38,154
Someone could have sculpted us
in this time.

431
00:24:38,325 --> 00:24:39,690
You know what? Let me take it.

432
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:43,057
They could operate all day long
And never figure out what went wrong

433
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:46,097
My God, you are--
You are Cole Porter in panties.

434
00:24:46,266 --> 00:24:49,758
Of course, having said that,
Cole Porter probably did wear panties.

435
00:24:49,937 --> 00:24:52,428
Anyway, thank you for inviting us.

436
00:24:52,606 --> 00:24:56,838
Okay, I'm just gonna take a real quick one.
Let me take it. Let me take it, Sophie.

437
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,778
- Thank you so much. That was great.
- Hang on.

438
00:24:59,947 --> 00:25:02,074
Nice to meet you guys. Bye-bye.

439
00:25:07,654 --> 00:25:09,713
So this is where Sophie works, eh?

440
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,858
Yeah. She is gonna be right out.

441
00:25:12,025 --> 00:25:14,255
Excellent. Excellent.
Thank you very much.

442
00:25:16,697 --> 00:25:17,959
So how much do you weigh?

443
00:25:18,465 --> 00:25:19,864
I fluctuate. Yeah.

444
00:25:23,537 --> 00:25:26,097
Okay, look, I am terribly sorry
to barge in like this...

445
00:25:26,273 --> 00:25:29,003
...but I have decided
I cannot take no for an answer.

446
00:25:29,176 --> 00:25:31,007
- I told you that--
- You're not a writer.

447
00:25:31,178 --> 00:25:33,646
Except when you are writing poems
and short stories...

448
00:25:33,814 --> 00:25:35,611
...in the New School literary magazine.

449
00:25:35,783 --> 00:25:37,444
I Googled you. And you were good.

450
00:25:37,618 --> 00:25:39,210
Look, I'm flattered.

451
00:25:39,386 --> 00:25:43,345
I mean, you're one of six people
in the world who's actually read those...

452
00:25:43,524 --> 00:25:45,890
...but that doesn't mean
I can write a song.

453
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:50,421
You already did.
Five minutes, that's all I ask.

454
00:25:51,265 --> 00:25:54,792
Please, step in. You'll enjoy this.
This is a treat.

455
00:25:55,636 --> 00:25:57,103
Mr. Fletcher. Nice to see you.

456
00:25:57,271 --> 00:25:59,671
- Very nice to see you, Mia, how are you?
- Wonderful.

457
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,308
I just want to get--
Can I try the new Mason & Hamlin?

458
00:26:02,476 --> 00:26:06,139
- Sure, absolutely. Be my guest.
- Thank you very much. Thanks. Please.

459
00:26:06,313 --> 00:26:10,579
This is-- It's just a little something
that you might possibly recognize.

460
00:26:12,085 --> 00:26:15,282
Figuring out you and me

461
00:26:15,456 --> 00:26:20,086
Is like doing a love autopsy

462
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:23,229
They could operate all day long

463
00:26:23,397 --> 00:26:26,958
And never figure out what went wrong

464
00:26:28,202 --> 00:26:30,432
Love autopsy

465
00:26:32,072 --> 00:26:34,199
Love autopsy

466
00:26:42,516 --> 00:26:45,280
What went wrong?

467
00:26:51,158 --> 00:26:54,184
God. That melody is so beautiful.

468
00:26:54,361 --> 00:26:56,352
But I've never written a song.

469
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:58,930
A song. I know, I know.
And if I'm wrong, I'm wrong.

470
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:03,126
I just don't think I am.
I think you may be a born lyricist.

471
00:27:05,739 --> 00:27:08,936
We don't have very long,
but what I'd like to do, in an ideal world...

472
00:27:09,109 --> 00:27:10,701
...is continue the "Autopsy" song.

473
00:27:10,878 --> 00:27:13,676
But I think it's gonna be very hard
to get back from there...

474
00:27:13,847 --> 00:27:16,907
...into "Way Back Into Love,"
which is the title that Cora demands.

475
00:27:17,084 --> 00:27:20,850
What we could do is continue
with Greg "the Angel of Death's" version.

476
00:27:21,021 --> 00:27:22,386
That's plagiarism.

477
00:27:22,556 --> 00:27:24,649
Yes. Yes, yes. Good. Excellent.

478
00:27:24,825 --> 00:27:27,419
I would never in a million years
use someone else's work.

479
00:27:27,594 --> 00:27:28,788
I'm very glad you agree.

480
00:27:28,962 --> 00:27:34,559
So, what we need,
we need something brand-new.

481
00:27:35,669 --> 00:27:39,070
- So let's see. A song for Cora.
- Yes.

482
00:27:39,239 --> 00:27:43,039
- Has to be called "A Way Back Into Love."
- Correct.

483
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:45,508
And it has to be something
Cora would sing about.

484
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:46,941
Good.

485
00:27:47,114 --> 00:27:49,275
And it has to be something
you would sing about.

486
00:27:49,449 --> 00:27:50,609
Good, yeah.

487
00:27:50,784 --> 00:27:53,947
- What would you sing about?
- Whatever gets me the job, really.

488
00:27:54,521 --> 00:27:56,887
Oh, that's inspiring.

489
00:28:02,262 --> 00:28:06,699
Okay. Two people
searching for love, for salvation.

490
00:28:06,867 --> 00:28:08,164
Good, good, I love that.

491
00:28:08,335 --> 00:28:11,702
Love lost, love found.

492
00:28:12,339 --> 00:28:13,670
Love lost again.

493
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,469
Yes, this is starting to sound
a little bit like luggage, but good.

494
00:28:36,163 --> 00:28:37,721
Thanks. That's really helpful.

495
00:28:38,332 --> 00:28:40,664
It doesn't have to be perfect.
Just spit it out.

496
00:28:40,834 --> 00:28:43,234
- They're just lyrics.
- "Just lyrics"?

497
00:28:44,237 --> 00:28:47,866
Lyrics are important.
They're just not as important as melody.

498
00:28:49,209 --> 00:28:50,870
I really don't think you get it.

499
00:28:51,345 --> 00:28:53,210
Oh, you look angry. Click your pen.

500
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,315
A melody is like seeing someone
for the first time.

501
00:28:56,483 --> 00:28:58,348
The physical attraction. Sex.

502
00:28:58,952 --> 00:29:00,817
I so get that.

503
00:29:00,988 --> 00:29:04,116
But then, as you get to know the person,
that's the lyrics.

504
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:06,919
Their story. Who they are underneath.

505
00:29:07,594 --> 00:29:11,860
It's the combination of the two
that makes it magic.

506
00:29:12,032 --> 00:29:13,624
Let's go for a walk.

507
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,769
- A walk? What, now?
- Yeah.

508
00:29:16,937 --> 00:29:21,271
Out on the streets you see things
and, you know, hear things and eat things.

509
00:29:21,441 --> 00:29:23,932
It all sort of unlocks your mind.

510
00:29:28,649 --> 00:29:30,310
This is good. This is good.

511
00:29:30,484 --> 00:29:32,748
When you hit a wall,
you gotta change the subject.

512
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:34,216
So why did PoP break up?

513
00:29:34,388 --> 00:29:37,186
I mean, Rhonda told me
that you guys were friends growing up?

514
00:29:37,357 --> 00:29:39,689
We were, yes,
and then Colin met a new manager...

515
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:42,090
...who convinced him
he was the star of the band.

516
00:29:42,262 --> 00:29:45,754
Shortly after, he left, taking the last
three songs we'd written together...

517
00:29:45,932 --> 00:29:49,698
...and putting them on his solo album
which went on to sell eight million records.

518
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:52,532
But how did you deal with that?

519
00:29:52,706 --> 00:29:54,640
Oh, with drugs, alcohol...

520
00:29:54,808 --> 00:29:58,835
...and ultimately, my own solo album.

521
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,778
Cool.

522
00:30:04,951 --> 00:30:07,511
This copy has been in the racks
for six years.

523
00:30:07,688 --> 00:30:09,417
- Come on.
- No, no. I check every week.

524
00:30:09,589 --> 00:30:12,057
You see, I made a little mark,
there on the back. See?

525
00:30:12,225 --> 00:30:15,058
It sold only 50,000 copies,
most of those to my mother.

526
00:30:15,228 --> 00:30:17,788
Rolling Stone called it
"a crass, contrived effort...

527
00:30:17,964 --> 00:30:20,489
...not even good enough
for a dentist chair."

528
00:30:21,968 --> 00:30:24,163
Well, I'm sure there were other reviews.

529
00:30:24,337 --> 00:30:26,737
There were, there were.
But none as good as that one.

530
00:30:26,907 --> 00:30:28,841
And they were right, by the way. Yeah.

531
00:30:31,311 --> 00:30:33,836
To cut a long story short,
I gave up trying to write...

532
00:30:34,014 --> 00:30:36,778
...lost an incredible amount of money
and then my apartment.

533
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:39,976
Chris stuck by me, booked me
an '80s reunion night on Long Island.

534
00:30:40,153 --> 00:30:42,246
And suddenly, they liked me again.

535
00:30:42,422 --> 00:30:44,652
It was weird.
It was like I'd never been away.

536
00:30:44,825 --> 00:30:46,725
The audience was a tad older, as was I...

537
00:30:46,893 --> 00:30:50,158
...but we were very, very profoundly happy
to see each other again.

538
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:53,163
And it went on from there.

539
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:56,860
Cruises. Reunions. Knott's Berry Farm,
which I'm sure you're familiar with.

540
00:30:57,037 --> 00:31:00,734
Busch Gardens,
that's one of my big fixtures of the year.

541
00:31:00,907 --> 00:31:02,238
What else can I tell you?

542
00:31:02,409 --> 00:31:05,936
I really appreciate
you opening up to me like this.

543
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:10,508
I know what it's like
to live with a shadow overhead.

544
00:31:14,221 --> 00:31:15,449
What?

545
00:31:17,824 --> 00:31:19,018
Shadow.

546
00:31:19,659 --> 00:31:24,323
I've been living with a shadow overhead

547
00:31:25,265 --> 00:31:27,495
Now, that's a nice melody, isn't it?

548
00:31:27,667 --> 00:31:29,464
- It's good.
- Thank you. Thank you.

549
00:31:29,636 --> 00:31:32,161
Mind you, what do you know?
You don't even like melody.

550
00:31:32,339 --> 00:31:34,000
I never said that.

551
00:31:34,174 --> 00:31:36,074
You prefer the lyrics.

552
00:31:36,243 --> 00:31:37,301
I don't trust you.

553
00:31:37,477 --> 00:31:38,842
Your turn, what's next?

554
00:31:39,813 --> 00:31:42,145
I think that we should get
some breakfast.

555
00:31:42,315 --> 00:31:45,113
Please, come on, we're finally
on a roll here. Listen again.

556
00:31:45,285 --> 00:31:49,051
I've been living with a shadow overhead

557
00:31:49,222 --> 00:31:52,385
There'll be no more rhymes until I'm fed

558
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,083
Please, seriously, seriously.

559
00:31:54,261 --> 00:31:56,354
I've been living with a shadow overhead

560
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:59,363
I could be inspired
With just a piece of bread

561
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,159
- I have the perfect place.
- Wait a minute.

562
00:32:02,335 --> 00:32:03,666
It's just on the next corner.

563
00:32:03,837 --> 00:32:05,737
- Keep moving and keep writing.
- All right.

564
00:32:05,906 --> 00:32:09,467
I've been looking
For someone to shed some light

565
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:11,807
- That's good. That's good.
- Yeah?

566
00:32:11,978 --> 00:32:13,843
Shadows and light. You're deep.

567
00:32:14,014 --> 00:32:16,847
Okay, we need two more lines
of Cora verse. What's next?

568
00:32:17,017 --> 00:32:18,348
Soph?

569
00:32:21,254 --> 00:32:22,243
Sophie?

570
00:32:23,757 --> 00:32:25,349
What are you doing?

571
00:32:25,525 --> 00:32:26,924
Nothing.

572
00:32:27,093 --> 00:32:31,086
I thought I saw someone,
but it wasn't him. So it's fine.

573
00:32:31,264 --> 00:32:34,665
- Oh, there he is.
- What?

574
00:32:34,835 --> 00:32:37,804
A very nice picture, though.
That's funny.

575
00:32:38,572 --> 00:32:41,905
Interestingly enough, I mean--
Well, it is a bookstore.

576
00:32:42,075 --> 00:32:44,236
- So, you know, that does happen.
- What?

577
00:32:45,812 --> 00:32:47,803
Gosh, where were we? Okay.

578
00:32:47,981 --> 00:32:49,278
Shadow overhead

579
00:32:49,449 --> 00:32:53,283
Okay, can I just say, with all due respect,
that you are clearly--

580
00:32:53,453 --> 00:32:55,421
What is the word?
--insane at this moment.

581
00:32:55,589 --> 00:32:58,422
And because, according to Chris,
we have less than 36 hours...

582
00:32:58,592 --> 00:33:01,720
...before Cora goes to do Leno,
at which point my career is over...

583
00:33:01,895 --> 00:33:07,299
...it would be infinitely better for me
if you were sane. So how can I help?

584
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:11,330
Do you know this book?

585
00:33:14,241 --> 00:33:17,472
Sally Michaels? Yes, yes.
Big bestseller. Yes.

586
00:33:17,644 --> 00:33:19,737
- Have you read it?
- No, of course not.

587
00:33:19,913 --> 00:33:23,974
Last book I read was The Alex Fletcher Story
by the editors of Teen Dream Magazine.

588
00:33:26,019 --> 00:33:27,486
Why?

589
00:33:32,025 --> 00:33:35,119
I'm Sally Michaels.

590
00:33:37,697 --> 00:33:41,224
I saw that they were giving these courses
on writing at the New School...

591
00:33:41,401 --> 00:33:43,392
...so I signed up.

592
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:46,971
And my teacher was Sloan Cates.

593
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,131
Brilliant, handsome.

594
00:33:49,309 --> 00:33:52,540
The truth is, I was in love with him.

595
00:33:53,313 --> 00:33:55,338
And we began spending
every minute together.

596
00:33:55,515 --> 00:33:59,315
Which is why I was sort of surprised
when his fiancÃ©e showed up.

597
00:34:00,587 --> 00:34:04,114
Yeah, he never mentioned that
he was engaged to a history professor...

598
00:34:04,291 --> 00:34:06,725
...who was on a year-long sabbatical
in Spain.

599
00:34:06,893 --> 00:34:09,384
And when she popped in
for an unexpected visit...

600
00:34:09,562 --> 00:34:13,157
...it sort of turned into a reenactment
of the Inquisition.

601
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,125
And that-- And that was that?
That was the end of that?

602
00:34:16,303 --> 00:34:18,396
Yeah. We never saw each other again.

603
00:34:18,571 --> 00:34:21,802
I dropped the class and a year later,
his new novel showed up.

604
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:24,039
The Sally What's-it novel.

605
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:26,940
"The tale of a student
with exalted literary aspirations...

606
00:34:27,113 --> 00:34:31,413
...who lures a brilliant writer into an affair
so she can take advantage of his connections.

607
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:36,252
But when he tries to break it off,
she devotes herself to ruining his life."

608
00:34:36,589 --> 00:34:38,921
Well, I mean, that obviously wasn't you.

609
00:34:40,026 --> 00:34:45,862
Well, she's a lit major from Long Island,
5'4", my color hair, all my habits.

610
00:34:46,032 --> 00:34:49,058
You know, talks to herself
and asks too many questions.

611
00:34:49,235 --> 00:34:51,669
Her parents founded
a weight reduction company...

612
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:53,601
...that now her sister runs.

613
00:34:54,007 --> 00:34:55,941
Well, anyway, I...

614
00:34:56,676 --> 00:34:59,372
Since then, every time I pick up a pen...

615
00:34:59,546 --> 00:35:02,947
...I'm haunted by those words
that he wrote, you know?

616
00:35:03,116 --> 00:35:06,142
"She was a brilliant mimic." You know.

617
00:35:06,319 --> 00:35:09,117
"She could ape Dorothy Parker
or Emily Dickinson...

618
00:35:09,289 --> 00:35:12,452
...but stripped of someone else's
literary clothes...

619
00:35:12,625 --> 00:35:17,028
...she was a vacant,
empty imitation of a writer."

620
00:35:17,931 --> 00:35:20,923
First of all, you can't listen to some jerk.

621
00:35:21,434 --> 00:35:24,801
He's not a jerk.
He's a National Book Award winner.

622
00:35:24,971 --> 00:35:28,372
Well, then, get the best revenge,
write a hit song.

623
00:35:29,275 --> 00:35:32,472
Honestly, I don't think a pop song
is gonna impress Sloan Cates.

624
00:35:32,879 --> 00:35:35,677
Oh, no, of course not.
Pop is just for morons. Forgot that.

625
00:35:35,849 --> 00:35:39,114
- I didn't mean anything by it.
- Brain-dead, or taken too many drugs.

626
00:35:39,285 --> 00:35:41,310
You know what I'd say
to you and Sloan Cates?

627
00:35:41,488 --> 00:35:43,649
You can take all the novels
in the world...

628
00:35:43,823 --> 00:35:47,054
...and not one of them
will make you feel as good as fast as:

629
00:35:53,933 --> 00:35:55,901
That is real poetry. Those are real poets.

630
00:35:56,069 --> 00:36:00,096
Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder,
Bob Dylan, the Beatles.

631
00:36:00,273 --> 00:36:04,232
Okay. What if one of your heroes
came up to you and said--

632
00:36:04,411 --> 00:36:06,971
You know, Smokey, what if he said:

633
00:36:07,147 --> 00:36:10,947
"Alex Fletcher,
you are a horrible songwriter"?

634
00:36:11,117 --> 00:36:12,106
How would you react?

635
00:36:12,285 --> 00:36:15,948
I know Smokey a little bit. He's too nice
a gentleman ever to say such a thing.

636
00:36:17,023 --> 00:36:20,288
Dylan might. Dylan would, actually.
In fact, Dylan did.

637
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:25,329
Okay, Dylan walks up to you and he says,
"You are a horrible songwriter."

638
00:36:26,699 --> 00:36:28,997
- How do you react?
- I would be horribly depressed.

639
00:36:29,169 --> 00:36:31,797
Yes. I would. I would.

640
00:36:31,971 --> 00:36:35,634
But then, after, you know,
months of brooding...

641
00:36:35,809 --> 00:36:38,642
...I would find a lyricist...

642
00:36:39,312 --> 00:36:42,907
...and write a song
about how horribly depressed I was.

643
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:46,712
And it would be a big hit, everyone
would love me, and I'd make lots of money.

644
00:36:46,886 --> 00:36:49,582
Suddenly I'd be less depressed
than if I just sat around...

645
00:36:49,756 --> 00:36:53,123
...being a little bit self-indulgent,
letting my misery eat away at me...

646
00:36:53,293 --> 00:36:58,196
...until I'd become an emotional wreck
and creatively completely moribund.

647
00:37:00,533 --> 00:37:02,296
Yes, moribund.

648
00:37:06,673 --> 00:37:08,334
- Okay, let's go. Come on.
- All right.

649
00:37:08,975 --> 00:37:12,741
I've been living with a shadow overhead

650
00:37:12,912 --> 00:37:16,848
I've been sleeping
With a clown above my bed

651
00:37:17,016 --> 00:37:19,576
- "Clown" is not right. What is that word?
- It's "cloud."

652
00:37:19,752 --> 00:37:23,279
- Write more clearly. How can I--?
- Why would you have a clown in your bed?

653
00:37:23,456 --> 00:37:26,118
- It would not be the first time.
- Yeah, I'm not surprised.

654
00:37:26,292 --> 00:37:28,692
- Write in capital letters.
- Why don't you write it?

655
00:37:28,862 --> 00:37:31,296
I'm sorry, Khan.
We're gonna come back in one second.

656
00:37:31,464 --> 00:37:34,194
You dictate, I'll write.
And I will write like a human...

657
00:37:34,367 --> 00:37:36,426
...and not like a small Pekingese dog.

658
00:37:36,603 --> 00:37:39,731
What are you doing, you madwoman?
You're destroying my apartment.

659
00:37:39,906 --> 00:37:42,170
I can't write from across the room.

660
00:37:42,342 --> 00:37:45,140
Well, you're not writing here.
Get back to your corner.

661
00:37:45,311 --> 00:37:46,300
I can't have you here.

662
00:37:46,479 --> 00:37:49,937
- I'll be blocked. I'll be completely stuck.
- So go out the other side.

663
00:37:50,116 --> 00:37:52,175
I've never been the other side.

664
00:37:53,052 --> 00:37:56,351
Push, push. Push, push.

665
00:38:01,661 --> 00:38:03,788
Good. Better.

666
00:38:03,963 --> 00:38:07,091
You're still a fraction close.
Just-- Just back off, just one...

667
00:38:07,267 --> 00:38:08,757
Just-- Just--

668
00:38:08,935 --> 00:38:10,402
There, fine, good.

669
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:12,060
Okay.

670
00:38:28,254 --> 00:38:31,087
And I don't think those chords are right.

671
00:38:31,257 --> 00:38:34,124
It has to sound different than the verse.

672
00:38:34,527 --> 00:38:36,518
What kind of different
did you have in mind?

673
00:38:36,696 --> 00:38:39,460
I don't know.
Something sadder, you know?

674
00:38:39,632 --> 00:38:42,863
And I still don't like my line
about "places in my mind."

675
00:38:43,036 --> 00:38:46,233
- It's fine.
- Fine isn't good.

676
00:38:46,406 --> 00:38:47,930
We only have time for fine.

677
00:38:48,107 --> 00:38:50,541
I tell you what.
We'll change "places in my mind"...

678
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:53,110
...if I can keep the chord sequence
into the bridge.

679
00:38:53,279 --> 00:38:54,712
This isn't a negotiation.

680
00:38:54,881 --> 00:38:58,009
It's either right or wrong,
inspired or insipid.

681
00:38:58,184 --> 00:39:02,120
It's 4 in the morning. We're not writing the
last movement of the "Jupiter Symphony."

682
00:39:02,288 --> 00:39:05,314
It's a song for someone who's last hit
was "Welcome to Bootytown."

683
00:39:05,491 --> 00:39:06,788
Please, get back to work.

684
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,656
I still don't like it.

685
00:39:09,829 --> 00:39:12,491
And it's "Entering Bootytown."

686
00:39:13,866 --> 00:39:16,334
And another thing,
the whole top section...

687
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:19,034
I mean, it's so close.
We're just not there yet.

688
00:39:19,205 --> 00:39:21,605
We just-- We have to focus
and stay, you know...

689
00:39:21,774 --> 00:39:24,368
...completely understanding
of what we're trying to say.

690
00:39:24,544 --> 00:39:27,604
Okay, you may now
start killing the next one.

691
00:39:30,283 --> 00:39:35,516
All I wanna do
Is find a way back into love

692
00:39:39,092 --> 00:39:44,962
I can't make it through
Without a way back into love

693
00:39:51,204 --> 00:39:52,865
You know, I'm tone-deaf.

694
00:40:14,694 --> 00:40:16,958
Hey, what do you think of this?

695
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:20,497
Just keep writing.
Cora is leaving in an hour.

696
00:40:46,492 --> 00:40:50,690
Listen, I was thinking that "corners"
was such a better word than "spaces."

697
00:40:50,863 --> 00:40:54,060
For "in the mind." "The corners
of my mind," rather than "the spaces."

698
00:40:54,233 --> 00:40:57,532
It just seems to have a better boundary
to it, you know?

699
00:40:57,704 --> 00:41:00,901
Should I speak to you
about this later? Okay.

700
00:41:10,216 --> 00:41:13,447
It sounds so good. I can't believe it.

701
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:15,382
And now...

702
00:41:15,555 --> 00:41:17,022
...vocals.

703
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:20,819
No, you see, you have to sing
into the microphone. It won't follow you.

704
00:41:20,993 --> 00:41:23,257
- But I can't.
- It's a duet for a man and a woman.

705
00:41:23,429 --> 00:41:24,953
We are as close as we've got.

706
00:41:25,131 --> 00:41:28,794
Your headphones and a level. You look nice.
You should wear them all the time.

707
00:41:28,968 --> 00:41:31,266
How is that?

708
00:41:31,437 --> 00:41:32,495
- Yes?
- Okay!

709
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,600
It's okay.

710
00:41:35,775 --> 00:41:37,970
And...

711
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:42,614
..."Way Back Into Love." Take one.

712
00:41:42,782 --> 00:41:45,046
Oh, God. I'm getting really nervous.

713
00:41:45,218 --> 00:41:47,482
You'll be fine.
Just use your normal nice voice...

714
00:41:47,653 --> 00:41:50,053
...that I've heard so much of
in the last three days.

715
00:41:50,223 --> 00:41:53,351
It's like my throat's closing up.
It's like anaphylactic.

716
00:41:53,526 --> 00:41:55,790
It's fine. It's just a three-minute song.

717
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:05,000
I've been living with a shadow overhead

718
00:42:05,171 --> 00:42:06,661
I've been sleeping with a...

719
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:09,637
Just a little bit louder.
This song is intended for humans.

720
00:42:09,809 --> 00:42:12,539
"Way Back Into Love." Take two.

721
00:42:15,581 --> 00:42:20,211
I've been living with a shadow overhead

722
00:42:20,386 --> 00:42:25,016
I've been sleeping
With a cloud above my bed

723
00:42:25,191 --> 00:42:28,388
I've been lonely for so long

724
00:42:29,429 --> 00:42:34,298
Trapped in the past
I just can't seem to move on

725
00:42:34,834 --> 00:42:39,430
I've been hiding all my hopes
And dreams away

726
00:42:39,605 --> 00:42:44,508
Just in case I ever need 'em
Again someday

727
00:42:44,677 --> 00:42:47,578
I've been setting aside time

728
00:42:48,347 --> 00:42:53,580
To clear a little space
In the corners of my mind

729
00:42:54,654 --> 00:43:01,253
All I wanna do
Is find a way back into love

730
00:43:04,197 --> 00:43:11,069
I can't make it through
Without a way back into love

731
00:43:11,571 --> 00:43:14,335
Hey, hey! Taxi! She's gonna have a baby!

732
00:43:14,507 --> 00:43:16,634
Hey, what if that were true?

733
00:43:16,809 --> 00:43:17,798
Another one.

734
00:43:45,938 --> 00:43:48,463
- Oh, my God. It's Cora.
- Okay, stay calm.

735
00:43:48,641 --> 00:43:51,109
- C, you remember Alex Fletcher.
- How are you, C?

736
00:43:51,277 --> 00:43:53,074
- Hi, Alex.
- Sophie Fisher, my lyricist.

737
00:43:53,246 --> 00:43:55,214
Hi. Aspiring lyricist, actually.

738
00:43:55,381 --> 00:43:57,076
So Ray tells me you have a song.

739
00:43:58,084 --> 00:44:01,053
We do. A little ditty. It's just a rough...

740
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:04,212
Yeah, go ahead, take it. Help yourself.

741
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:05,948
Oh, we're gonna do it now?

742
00:44:06,125 --> 00:44:09,652
Great, great. No time like the present.

743
00:44:09,829 --> 00:44:14,163
Very rough. Just put together
in my little studio. Both of us singing.

744
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:16,426
She's gonna hear my voice,
it's gonna ruin it.

745
00:44:16,602 --> 00:44:17,591
It's gonna be fine.

746
00:44:23,009 --> 00:44:25,569
Anyone see Battle of the '80s Has-Beens
the other night?

747
00:44:25,745 --> 00:44:27,736
That Debbie Gibson,
she can take a punch.

748
00:44:33,586 --> 00:44:35,486
I didn't see it.

749
00:45:24,036 --> 00:45:27,096
This is the song I've been looking for.
I can't wait to work on it.

750
00:45:27,273 --> 00:45:29,070
Congratulations, guys. We gotta book.

751
00:45:29,241 --> 00:45:32,074
Thank you so much.
Looking forward to working with you guys.

752
00:45:32,244 --> 00:45:33,370
Congratulations.

753
00:45:33,546 --> 00:45:34,945
- D Money!
- Let's go home.

754
00:45:35,114 --> 00:45:36,376
This way, folks.

755
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:39,211
It's unbelievable. We got the job.

756
00:45:40,019 --> 00:45:42,249
I thank you. Thank you.

757
00:45:43,189 --> 00:45:46,283
I thank you, I thank you...

758
00:45:49,395 --> 00:45:52,262
Yes? Chris, she loved it.

759
00:45:52,431 --> 00:45:54,194
Unbelievable!

760
00:45:54,367 --> 00:45:56,358
Definitely. Where are you?

761
00:45:56,535 --> 00:45:58,298
Okay, got it. Got it.

762
00:45:58,471 --> 00:46:00,701
We're going to dinner. Come on.

763
00:46:02,208 --> 00:46:07,111
To Sophie Fisher, the woman who paved
my way back to Knott's Berry Farm.

764
00:46:07,279 --> 00:46:09,008
Gloria, I love your dress.

765
00:46:09,181 --> 00:46:12,173
Oh, thank you.
It's nice to clean up after a day of work.

766
00:46:12,351 --> 00:46:13,477
Where do you work?

767
00:46:13,653 --> 00:46:16,019
I'm a therapist at Columbia-Presbyterian.

768
00:46:16,188 --> 00:46:18,588
I'm working on a study
examining the relationship--

769
00:46:18,758 --> 00:46:19,782
Oh, my God.

770
00:46:19,959 --> 00:46:22,450
That's a strike against us, right?
I mean...

771
00:46:22,628 --> 00:46:25,756
What is it? What?

772
00:46:25,931 --> 00:46:28,195
- Sloan.
- Sloan?

773
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:33,738
Mr. Cates, good evening.
How are you? Nice to see you.

774
00:46:33,906 --> 00:46:35,737
I'd say about two minutes.

775
00:46:38,144 --> 00:46:40,806
- Hi, how you doing?
- Here it comes.

776
00:46:42,448 --> 00:46:44,109
Here's the thing...

777
00:46:58,931 --> 00:47:00,330
Is she all right?

778
00:47:02,068 --> 00:47:05,299
Yeah, she always does this.
It's her way of working up an appetite.

779
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:06,460
Hang on.

780
00:47:13,045 --> 00:47:15,013
Hello? Sophie?

781
00:47:15,181 --> 00:47:16,648
He's at the bar.

782
00:47:16,816 --> 00:47:19,580
I know. I know. I know.
I saw him. I saw him.

783
00:47:19,752 --> 00:47:22,880
He's not that great, you know.
I saw the beginnings of a bald patch.

784
00:47:23,055 --> 00:47:26,388
- Why, come and have a look.
- Oh, he has a great head of hair.

785
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:27,856
Oh, God.

786
00:47:28,027 --> 00:47:30,188
I think I'll just stay in here
until he leaves.

787
00:47:30,362 --> 00:47:32,887
Maybe you could send in a salad
and an iced tea?

788
00:47:33,065 --> 00:47:36,296
Right. I'll get the waiter.
Would you like the dessert cart as well?

789
00:47:36,469 --> 00:47:38,369
Look, this is ridiculous.

790
00:47:39,371 --> 00:47:41,566
I've been dreaming
about confronting him too.

791
00:47:41,741 --> 00:47:44,710
I had a speech prepared for over a year.

792
00:47:45,745 --> 00:47:47,804
Would you like to hear it?

793
00:47:48,614 --> 00:47:50,479
Very, very much.

794
00:47:51,751 --> 00:47:53,981
Hello there. Good evening.

795
00:47:57,022 --> 00:48:01,652
Sloan, even though Sally Michaels
only lives on paper...

796
00:48:01,827 --> 00:48:03,260
...I live in the world.

797
00:48:03,429 --> 00:48:06,626
And I can never forgive you
for using me as raw material...

798
00:48:06,799 --> 00:48:08,824
...to create a fictional monster.

799
00:48:09,001 --> 00:48:11,367
Sally Michaels
is my own personal ghost...

800
00:48:11,537 --> 00:48:14,995
...a shadow hanging over each phone call
and cup of iced tea.

801
00:48:15,174 --> 00:48:19,338
And one cold day, when age
has robbed your mind of its fertile phrases...

802
00:48:19,512 --> 00:48:23,278
...and your hand of its dexterity, all
the success won't be able to shield you...

803
00:48:23,449 --> 00:48:26,043
...from the pain you've caused
and the shame you deserve.

804
00:48:26,218 --> 00:48:28,118
Or something like that.

805
00:48:28,721 --> 00:48:31,121
But now I know
I could never actually say it to him.

806
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:34,555
No. You have to say that. You have
to say that. You have to say it now.

807
00:48:34,727 --> 00:48:37,127
Now is the perfect time.
You're on top of the world.

808
00:48:37,296 --> 00:48:39,696
You wrote a song
for the biggest act in the universe.

809
00:48:39,865 --> 00:48:41,162
- But I can't.
- Yeah, you can.

810
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:43,995
People wait to see an ex-lover
when things are going well.

811
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:46,934
It never happens.
You can make relationship history here.

812
00:48:47,106 --> 00:48:50,439
But I can't. I mean, look at me.
I haven't showered in days.

813
00:48:50,609 --> 00:48:53,874
I'm covered in songwriting grime.
The helicopter flew bugs in my teeth.

814
00:48:54,046 --> 00:48:57,140
Yes, yes, yes. You are a little mangy.

815
00:48:58,984 --> 00:49:01,714
Wait. Wait. Stay.

816
00:49:06,959 --> 00:49:09,928
Sorry, Gloria.
Can I ask you a great favor?

817
00:49:10,095 --> 00:49:13,587
Could you accompany me
to the ladies' room?

818
00:49:15,534 --> 00:49:18,059
He's a good guy. Go ahead.

819
00:49:18,237 --> 00:49:21,365
- Thank you. Thanks.
- Sure. Be right back.

820
00:49:29,849 --> 00:49:32,682
- That's fantastic.
- You look great.

821
00:49:32,852 --> 00:49:36,049
Eleven years of therapy and I finally
help someone. Good luck, honey.

822
00:49:36,222 --> 00:49:37,211
Thank you so much.

823
00:49:37,389 --> 00:49:39,880
Yes, thank you. Thank you, doctor.

824
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:41,548
It doesn't really fit.

825
00:49:41,727 --> 00:49:44,127
- No, on the contrary. It fits you perfectly.
- Really?

826
00:49:44,296 --> 00:49:46,856
I'm not saying you should go
to confession like that...

827
00:49:47,032 --> 00:49:49,432
...but for what you're about to do,
it's perfect.

828
00:49:50,903 --> 00:49:52,461
Okay. Are you ready?

829
00:49:53,172 --> 00:49:56,005
I think I'm developing
a sudden coronary blockage.

830
00:49:56,175 --> 00:49:57,574
Those pass very quickly, okay?

831
00:49:57,743 --> 00:49:59,472
Shortness of breath. Blurred vision.

832
00:49:59,645 --> 00:50:01,112
- You're fine.
- Scurvy?

833
00:50:02,348 --> 00:50:03,906
You're beautiful. No, it's fine.

834
00:50:04,083 --> 00:50:06,779
"I don't write bestsellers
because I despise humanity."

835
00:50:06,952 --> 00:50:11,651
And I said, "No, John, you don't write
bestsellers because the feeling is mutual."

836
00:50:12,858 --> 00:50:16,191
Should I have stopped? Should
I have stopped right there? Was it over?

837
00:50:16,362 --> 00:50:20,765
Hi. Sophie. My God, Sophie.

838
00:50:21,901 --> 00:50:24,096
How are you?

839
00:50:26,572 --> 00:50:28,233
I'm fine, yeah.

840
00:50:28,407 --> 00:50:30,932
Good, it's great to see you.

841
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:35,444
- Alex Fletcher. Hi, how are you?
- Hey, Alex. Sloan Cates. How are you?

842
00:50:35,614 --> 00:50:39,812
Well, it's been an eternity.
You look incredible.

843
00:50:40,486 --> 00:50:44,081
Then you were always
mysteriously seductive, weren't you?

844
00:50:44,857 --> 00:50:47,690
She is writing a song for Cora Corman.

845
00:50:48,661 --> 00:50:52,563
What? No. Wait. You're a songwriter?

846
00:50:52,731 --> 00:50:55,291
I-- I wrote...

847
00:50:55,467 --> 00:50:57,492
Brilliant lyrics. Fantastic lyrics.

848
00:50:57,670 --> 00:51:00,332
A lot of people
are talking about them, actually.

849
00:51:00,506 --> 00:51:03,066
I had a pen, a paper and wrote...

850
00:51:05,644 --> 00:51:10,047
Sloan, the thing is, even though
Sally Michaels only lives on paper...

851
00:51:10,215 --> 00:51:11,842
...Sophie lives in the real world.

852
00:51:12,017 --> 00:51:13,245
She can never forgive you--

853
00:51:13,419 --> 00:51:15,944
- Mr. Cates, your table's ready.
- Great, thanks, Stefan.

854
00:51:16,121 --> 00:51:19,352
Listen, I'll be right there, guys. I'm sorry.

855
00:51:19,525 --> 00:51:22,255
They're throwing
this little dinner thing for me.

856
00:51:22,428 --> 00:51:25,397
It's crazy how lavish people get
no matter how cheap they are...

857
00:51:25,564 --> 00:51:27,589
- ...when Hollywood comes calling.
- Hollywood.

858
00:51:27,766 --> 00:51:30,462
I've sold out. They're making a film
out of Sally Michaels.

859
00:51:30,636 --> 00:51:31,625
- Really?
- Yeah.

860
00:51:31,804 --> 00:51:33,999
It's been crazy. I wrote the script.

861
00:51:34,173 --> 00:51:36,573
We're seeing actresses.
It's been-- You know.

862
00:51:37,476 --> 00:51:40,843
But listen, it's great seeing you.
Let's get together, okay?

863
00:51:43,315 --> 00:51:45,112
Take care of yourself.

864
00:51:47,453 --> 00:51:49,284
Take care, Allen.

865
00:51:54,093 --> 00:51:55,560
Well...

866
00:51:56,195 --> 00:51:58,789
...must feel good to get that over with.

867
00:52:02,901 --> 00:52:04,232
I just wanna go home.

868
00:52:04,403 --> 00:52:06,963
Okay. Okay. Okay.

869
00:52:07,139 --> 00:52:10,302
Hang on. Just hang on one second.
One second.

870
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:13,305
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry to bother you.

871
00:52:13,479 --> 00:52:16,812
It would mean the world if you'd
just let her say what she came to say.

872
00:52:16,982 --> 00:52:18,779
I know what she came here to say, okay?

873
00:52:18,951 --> 00:52:21,784
Some sad little story
about how I ruined her life...

874
00:52:21,954 --> 00:52:23,421
...while the truth is...

875
00:52:26,291 --> 00:52:29,226
...that she seduced me
so that I'd help get her published, okay?

876
00:52:29,395 --> 00:52:32,387
Come on. You were engaged
and you never even told her.

877
00:52:32,898 --> 00:52:35,162
I'd say we're done talking.

878
00:52:35,334 --> 00:52:36,767
Bye-bye.

879
00:52:39,972 --> 00:52:42,338
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

880
00:52:42,508 --> 00:52:44,408
Wait.

881
00:52:46,211 --> 00:52:49,237
Do me a favor.
Why don't you just shove off?

882
00:52:49,415 --> 00:52:52,907
I appreciate your request,
but why don't you just shove off?

883
00:52:53,085 --> 00:52:56,282
- Take it easy, my friend.
- I don't believe I will take it easy.

884
00:52:57,322 --> 00:52:59,085
All right. All right!

885
00:53:00,325 --> 00:53:04,022
Don't hurt his hair.
He's working Adventureland this weekend.

886
00:53:04,196 --> 00:53:06,756
I'm giving up. My face is in the butter.

887
00:53:10,669 --> 00:53:12,227
Thank you.

888
00:53:13,005 --> 00:53:14,666
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

889
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:18,435
It's just my PoP hip. It comes from years
of doing our patented dance move.

890
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:20,703
My God, I've suffered for my art.

891
00:53:20,879 --> 00:53:23,074
No, the thing that really hurts
is my upper gum.

892
00:53:23,248 --> 00:53:25,580
I think I may have impaled myself
on a dinner roll.

893
00:53:25,751 --> 00:53:28,686
Good thing they didn't have breadsticks.
I could've lost an eye.

894
00:53:28,854 --> 00:53:30,879
Well, you should get some ice on that.

895
00:53:31,056 --> 00:53:33,217
Only if it's attached to some whiskey.

896
00:53:33,392 --> 00:53:36,555
Oh, God. I can't believe
you convinced me to do that.

897
00:53:36,728 --> 00:53:39,822
Now I'm more of a joke to him than ever.

898
00:53:39,998 --> 00:53:40,987
And to top it off...

899
00:53:41,433 --> 00:53:44,800
...I'll have my own personal nightmare
playing on 3000 screens.

900
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:47,700
And you know what the worst part is?

901
00:53:47,873 --> 00:53:49,568
You stole some poor woman's dress?

902
00:53:49,741 --> 00:53:54,371
The worst part is that
he still has some kind of power over me.

903
00:53:54,546 --> 00:53:56,571
I still care what he thinks.

904
00:53:56,748 --> 00:53:59,114
I'm sorry, but how?

905
00:53:59,284 --> 00:54:03,744
How can that possibly be?
The guy is a jerk.

906
00:54:05,023 --> 00:54:06,820
Well, that's easy for you to say, but--

907
00:54:06,992 --> 00:54:10,052
No. He is a jerk. He is a jerk.
It's not a question. He is a jerk.

908
00:54:10,229 --> 00:54:13,357
No, he is, he's a jerk. He's a jerk.
Okay, here's what I think.

909
00:54:13,532 --> 00:54:17,059
I think that the truth is that you are terrified
of losing Sally Michaels...

910
00:54:17,236 --> 00:54:21,673
...because you'd have nothing to hide behind
and you'd have to stand on your own feet.

911
00:54:24,443 --> 00:54:28,436
Wow. I didn't see that coming.

912
00:54:28,847 --> 00:54:30,439
No. Well...

913
00:54:30,616 --> 00:54:32,516
...I have amazing insight.

914
00:54:32,684 --> 00:54:35,448
I would use it on myself,
only I don't have any problems.

915
00:54:36,889 --> 00:54:38,720
And I will tell you my other insight.

916
00:54:38,891 --> 00:54:42,725
I think you are way too talented
and gifted...

917
00:54:42,895 --> 00:54:47,195
...and unusual to let anyone
keep you from standing.

918
00:54:51,603 --> 00:54:54,333
That's wonderfully sensitive, Alex.

919
00:54:54,506 --> 00:54:57,236
Especially from a man
who wears such tight pants.

920
00:54:57,776 --> 00:55:00,267
It forces all the blood to my heart.

921
00:55:09,351 --> 00:55:10,943
Listen.

922
00:55:11,487 --> 00:55:14,388
You were amazing tonight.

923
00:55:15,191 --> 00:55:16,556
As were you.

924
00:55:16,725 --> 00:55:19,387
The few syllables you got out
were absolutely devastating.

925
00:55:25,134 --> 00:55:26,829
Does this feel any better?

926
00:55:27,269 --> 00:55:29,464
It would if it was on the right side.

927
00:55:42,318 --> 00:55:43,979
And that...

928
00:55:45,487 --> 00:55:47,455
...felt much better.

929
00:56:45,214 --> 00:56:47,978
- Hello? Hello?
- Hey, buddy.

930
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:49,742
How's my hit songwriter?

931
00:56:50,386 --> 00:56:51,751
Hang on. Just-- Just hang on.

932
00:56:53,155 --> 00:56:56,318
You don't sound right.
Maybe it's the connect-- Hello?

933
00:56:57,059 --> 00:56:58,890
I have a strange situation here.

934
00:56:59,061 --> 00:57:01,291
Oh, you've got a strange situation?

935
00:57:01,463 --> 00:57:05,763
I'm at Beth's soccer game with my ex-wife
who's here with my ex-gardener.

936
00:57:05,934 --> 00:57:08,027
They came on a riding mower.

937
00:57:08,203 --> 00:57:09,670
I slept with Sophie.

938
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:12,602
You slept with Sophie?

939
00:57:12,775 --> 00:57:16,211
Remember your blood pressure.
You're a tall man. You need all you can get.

940
00:57:16,378 --> 00:57:19,438
Are you out of your mind?
Alex, this is terrible.

941
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:23,676
Unless, of course, you're happy about it,
and then I couldn't be more pleased for you.

942
00:57:23,852 --> 00:57:25,843
- Should we do pros and cons?
- Not necessary.

943
00:57:27,456 --> 00:57:29,856
- I think she's up. I gotta go.
- We got a show today.

944
00:57:30,025 --> 00:57:32,425
Two o'clock. I'm gonna pick you up
in a little while.

945
00:57:32,594 --> 00:57:36,189
I want you to wear the white shirt
with the fan-friendly pants.

946
00:57:36,365 --> 00:57:38,890
Too much. Too much.
Hanging up on you. Hanging up.

947
00:57:39,768 --> 00:57:40,757
Good morning.

948
00:57:42,037 --> 00:57:44,733
- Hi.
- That was Chris just checking in.

949
00:57:45,541 --> 00:57:49,238
So I'm gonna help clean up a little bit...

950
00:57:49,411 --> 00:57:51,743
...seeing as we don't
have any work today.

951
00:57:51,914 --> 00:57:54,109
Right. Fine. Thank you. Very nice of you.

952
00:57:54,283 --> 00:57:57,719
I would obviously invite you to stay,
it's just that I have a show today.

953
00:57:58,387 --> 00:58:00,548
- Oh, really?
- Oh, yes. A big one.

954
00:58:00,723 --> 00:58:03,123
I'm headlining
at Adventureland Amusement Park:

955
00:58:03,292 --> 00:58:05,317
Long Island's family fun center.

956
00:58:05,494 --> 00:58:07,962
Biggest outdoor amusement center
east of Rye Playland.

957
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:11,156
- You have my permission to be impressed.
- Sounds great.

958
00:58:11,333 --> 00:58:13,858
- Okay.
- Yeah.

959
00:58:14,036 --> 00:58:16,163
- So.
- So.

960
00:58:18,006 --> 00:58:19,496
I mean, you...

961
00:58:21,577 --> 00:58:23,442
You could come.

962
00:58:32,121 --> 00:58:35,022
I said I wasn't gonna lose my head

963
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:39,854
- But then pop goes my heart
- Pop goes my heart

964
00:58:40,028 --> 00:58:42,553
I wasn't gonna fall in love again

965
00:58:42,731 --> 00:58:46,633
- But then pop goes my heart
- Pop goes my heart

966
00:58:46,802 --> 00:58:52,001
And I just can't let you go

967
00:58:52,174 --> 00:58:55,166
I can't lose this feeling

968
00:58:57,546 --> 00:58:59,343
Okay. Let's hear everyone clapping.

969
00:59:01,049 --> 00:59:05,281
Hey, come on. These guys over here on line
at the Little Dipper, let's hear you clapping.

970
00:59:08,123 --> 00:59:09,988
Don't-- Don't if you don't want to.

971
00:59:10,159 --> 00:59:13,185
A twist of fate makes life worthwhile

972
00:59:13,362 --> 00:59:18,322
You are gold and silver

973
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,764
I said I wasn't gonna lose my head

974
00:59:20,936 --> 00:59:24,463
- But then pop goes my heart
- Pop goes my heart

975
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:30,476
And I just can't let you go

976
00:59:35,384 --> 00:59:39,616
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Adventureland. Thank you.

977
00:59:40,756 --> 00:59:42,747
Thank you.

978
00:59:43,959 --> 00:59:46,393
That was great. That was great.

979
00:59:46,562 --> 00:59:48,621
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

980
00:59:48,797 --> 00:59:51,197
Good show.
All right, you gotta do the encore.

981
00:59:52,067 --> 00:59:55,230
- Do I really have to?
- It's in the contract.

982
00:59:55,404 --> 00:59:57,998
Wanna do "Meaningless Kiss"
or "Dance With Me Tonight"?

983
00:59:58,774 --> 01:00:00,708
This is embarrassing. They don't want it.

984
01:00:00,876 --> 01:00:03,674
No, it's not.
These songs, they're fantastic.

985
01:00:04,379 --> 01:00:06,506
I mean, I've never heard
most of them before...

986
01:00:06,682 --> 01:00:10,584
...but they're full of wonderful
melodic surprises and they're catchy...

987
01:00:10,752 --> 01:00:13,346
...and they're making people happy
and they're just good.

988
01:00:13,522 --> 01:00:15,888
So you should be incredibly proud
to sing them.

989
01:00:17,759 --> 01:00:20,728
You're not just saying that
because you've been on the wave ride?

990
01:00:20,896 --> 01:00:23,865
They're good, really good.

991
01:00:27,903 --> 01:00:31,270
Okay, then.
"Dance With Me Tonight," please.

992
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:34,568
It's not often one man
gets to say that to another with such joy.

993
01:00:40,015 --> 01:00:41,642
Thank you.

994
01:00:43,819 --> 01:00:46,447
Okay. PoP face.

995
01:00:57,199 --> 01:00:59,099
Thank you.

996
01:01:06,909 --> 01:01:09,377
It's been so long

997
01:01:09,545 --> 01:01:12,343
Since I've known right from wrong

998
01:01:12,514 --> 01:01:14,311
Got no job

999
01:01:14,483 --> 01:01:17,919
Sometimes I just sit down and sob

1000
01:01:18,086 --> 01:01:23,149
Wondering if anything will go right

1001
01:01:24,726 --> 01:01:28,594
Or will you dance with me tonight

1002
01:01:28,764 --> 01:01:30,698
When the sun departs

1003
01:01:30,866 --> 01:01:34,029
I feel a hole down in my heart

1004
01:01:34,202 --> 01:01:35,635
Put on some shoes

1005
01:01:35,804 --> 01:01:39,763
Come down here and listen to the blues

1006
01:01:39,942 --> 01:01:45,278
Wondering if anything will go right

1007
01:01:46,548 --> 01:01:50,109
Or will you dance with me tonight

1008
01:01:50,285 --> 01:01:52,719
I'm looking at you

1009
01:01:52,888 --> 01:01:55,186
You're looking at me

1010
01:01:55,357 --> 01:01:58,588
We're the only two off the dance floor

1011
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,990
Do you see what I see?

1012
01:02:01,163 --> 01:02:03,654
Two broken lives

1013
01:02:03,832 --> 01:02:06,096
Working in harmony

1014
01:02:06,268 --> 01:02:08,964
Might make for a decent time

1015
01:02:09,137 --> 01:02:11,230
So get up and dance with me

1016
01:02:13,241 --> 01:02:15,539
It was a great show.
You should be very pleased.

1017
01:02:15,711 --> 01:02:17,303
How much money did we make?

1018
01:02:17,479 --> 01:02:20,471
I don't talk business in front of a non-client.
You know that.

1019
01:02:20,649 --> 01:02:23,209
Actually, I'm thinking
about signing with you.

1020
01:02:23,819 --> 01:02:27,482
Well, well, thank you, Sophie.
That's-- That's terrific.

1021
01:02:27,656 --> 01:02:31,592
In that case, I don't think it's right
to talk about one client's business affairs...

1022
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,354
...in front of another client.
I'm discreet that way.

1023
01:02:34,529 --> 01:02:37,589
You don't know how much money
we made, do you?

1024
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,565
I have a ballpark figure.

1025
01:02:39,735 --> 01:02:41,259
Is it enough for a nice dinner?

1026
01:02:41,436 --> 01:02:44,269
Dinner. I'm supposed to go
to Rhonda's for dinner. I'm late.

1027
01:02:44,439 --> 01:02:46,270
Oh, God, help.

1028
01:02:46,441 --> 01:02:50,241
You know, she wouldn't yell at me
if you came.

1029
01:02:52,914 --> 01:02:54,677
Oh, very well.

1030
01:02:57,819 --> 01:02:59,650
I can't go.

1031
01:03:04,893 --> 01:03:07,794
I'm losing my mind.
You've got me frazzled.

1032
01:03:09,197 --> 01:03:12,894
- Oh, there you go. You're gonna love these.
- Thank you. That's plenty. Honestly.

1033
01:03:13,068 --> 01:03:15,764
Trust me, you're gonna want
even more than that. Say when.

1034
01:03:15,937 --> 01:03:19,202
When, when, when. Thank you.
Thank you. That's plenty. Thank you.

1035
01:03:19,374 --> 01:03:20,773
- One more. Trust me.
- No.

1036
01:03:20,942 --> 01:03:23,308
Listen, now, I don't wanna be
presumptuous...

1037
01:03:23,478 --> 01:03:26,345
...but I'm about to open
a new Weight-Not in Boca...

1038
01:03:26,515 --> 01:03:28,983
...and I was wondering
if maybe you'd like to perform.

1039
01:03:29,151 --> 01:03:32,211
Sounds wonderful. I performed
at a fat farm once. They loved me.

1040
01:03:32,387 --> 01:03:34,787
I threw out treats from the stage.
They went crazy.

1041
01:03:34,956 --> 01:03:36,423
It was like a dietetic Altamont.

1042
01:03:38,593 --> 01:03:39,582
That's funny.

1043
01:03:39,761 --> 01:03:43,094
- Honey, no cellphones at the table.
- Could be Jessie about the meeting.

1044
01:03:43,265 --> 01:03:46,826
If we break the rules, what'll the kids think?
Don't. Sorry, Alex. Very rude.

1045
01:03:47,002 --> 01:03:49,994
Weirdo, is there a way
we could go to the Cora show?

1046
01:03:50,172 --> 01:03:52,367
- That would be so cool.
- We could work that out.

1047
01:03:52,541 --> 01:03:55,066
I believe we can.
I believe we've become close friends.

1048
01:03:55,243 --> 01:03:56,938
Don't bug him with stuff like that.

1049
01:03:57,112 --> 01:04:00,445
Sorry, sorry, sorry. Apologies.
I know the rules. Turn it off.

1050
01:04:00,615 --> 01:04:03,277
Oh, no, honey. You go right ahead.
You're a guest.

1051
01:04:03,452 --> 01:04:06,353
You sure? You want me
to call Jessie back while I'm...?

1052
01:04:06,855 --> 01:04:08,152
I'll be very quick.

1053
01:04:08,323 --> 01:04:11,087
Chris, yes? Say that again.
Cora's people what?

1054
01:04:11,259 --> 01:04:12,954
What? Is it about the song?

1055
01:04:13,328 --> 01:04:14,420
Really?

1056
01:04:14,596 --> 01:04:16,029
- What does he say?
- It's Sophie.

1057
01:04:16,765 --> 01:04:18,255
Really?

1058
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:21,164
Okay. Okay, got it.

1059
01:04:21,703 --> 01:04:23,170
Cora is back in town tomorrow...

1060
01:04:23,338 --> 01:04:26,830
...and wants to meet us at her studio
to work on the song.

1061
01:04:27,008 --> 01:04:30,102
And she wants to know
if we like wheatgrass.

1062
01:04:30,278 --> 01:04:32,212
- Sounds ominous.
- Are you worried?

1063
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:35,872
- Well, I don't-- You know, yeah.
- If you're not worried, I'm not worried.

1064
01:04:36,051 --> 01:04:39,509
You've got your worried eyes.
You look like a little worried doggy.

1065
01:04:50,031 --> 01:04:53,000
Sophie, bring those dishes in here, hon.

1066
01:04:58,006 --> 01:05:01,134
Okay, honey. You lead, I'll follow.

1067
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:07,675
- There you go. There you go.
- What?

1068
01:05:08,216 --> 01:05:09,808
Nothing. Just looking.

1069
01:05:11,553 --> 01:05:13,817
What? What? What, what, what?

1070
01:05:13,989 --> 01:05:17,584
- Well, look. As your older sister--
- Seven years older.

1071
01:05:17,759 --> 01:05:19,124
Now, that's just uncalled for.

1072
01:05:19,294 --> 01:05:21,888
Why do you do that?
It just-- It hurts, you know?

1073
01:05:22,063 --> 01:05:26,124
Look. I like Alex, you know.
I mean, he's Alex Fletcher. So hot.

1074
01:05:26,301 --> 01:05:27,700
And he ate my mashed potatoes.

1075
01:05:27,869 --> 01:05:29,461
Yes. It was a magical evening.

1076
01:05:29,638 --> 01:05:31,833
But look, hon, you don't fall a lot.

1077
01:05:32,007 --> 01:05:35,534
And I've seen the way you look at him,
so if you are falling for him...

1078
01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:39,202
...just please, please make sure
he's passionate about you.

1079
01:05:39,381 --> 01:05:43,715
Well, you know, I mean, I'm not falling.
We're just working together, you know?

1080
01:05:43,885 --> 01:05:47,582
And besides, the one time we slept
together, it's been totally professional.

1081
01:05:47,756 --> 01:05:49,223
- You did not.
- I did.

1082
01:05:49,391 --> 01:05:51,291
You slept with Alex Fletcher?

1083
01:05:51,459 --> 01:05:52,687
Oh, my God.

1084
01:05:53,862 --> 01:05:55,523
Don't worry about it, all right?

1085
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:03,030
Besides, you know,
how do you know who's passionate?

1086
01:06:04,573 --> 01:06:08,339
You know, I think you--
I think you just see it in their eyes.

1087
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:11,104
And you feel it in their touch.

1088
01:06:11,513 --> 01:06:15,074
In Gary's case, it was when he said
to his mother, "I'm marrying her anyway."

1089
01:06:15,784 --> 01:06:17,411
God, I hate her.

1090
01:06:18,620 --> 01:06:21,987
I don't know. I think it's just
when they do something extraordinary.

1091
01:06:22,924 --> 01:06:25,449
Soph, just be careful, okay?

1092
01:06:25,627 --> 01:06:27,094
Okay.

1093
01:06:32,634 --> 01:06:36,593
And bigger. And bigger. And bigger.

1094
01:06:38,473 --> 01:06:40,304
With claps, and:

1095
01:06:42,377 --> 01:06:45,278
Ready to spin. And:

1096
01:06:51,386 --> 01:06:53,946
Well, that was fun.

1097
01:06:54,122 --> 01:06:56,386
It was, it was, it was.
Except for those potatoes.

1098
01:06:56,558 --> 01:06:58,924
What I imagine eating insulation
would taste like.

1099
01:07:00,295 --> 01:07:02,991
So Cora tomorrow?

1100
01:07:03,164 --> 01:07:06,497
Yes, tomorrow, 10:00,
her studio, 19th Street.

1101
01:07:07,435 --> 01:07:10,427
- Should I meet you there?
- That would be fine.

1102
01:07:10,605 --> 01:07:12,368
Although I was gonna take a cab.

1103
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:14,735
And seeing as I live
further uptown than you...

1104
01:07:14,910 --> 01:07:17,174
...I could, theoretically, pick you up.

1105
01:07:17,779 --> 01:07:21,271
You could if I was on the street
at, say, like, 9:40.

1106
01:07:21,449 --> 01:07:24,475
I would probably see you, depending
how brightly you were dressed.

1107
01:07:24,653 --> 01:07:26,553
I'd wear orange so you couldn't miss me.

1108
01:07:26,721 --> 01:07:28,985
You could get some road work done
while you wait.

1109
01:07:34,896 --> 01:07:38,423
Well, goodbye and thank you.
Thank you very much for this. I enjoyed it.

1110
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:42,229
- And thank you for your support today.
- Thank you. Today was great.

1111
01:07:43,305 --> 01:07:45,364
- It was.
- Okay. Bye.

1112
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:47,098
Goodbye.

1113
01:07:54,783 --> 01:07:55,807
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1114
01:08:28,183 --> 01:08:31,641
I want you to hear the new intro
to "Way Back Into Love."

1115
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:33,048
So imagine this:

1116
01:08:33,221 --> 01:08:35,689
Instead of just starting the song
with the piano...

1117
01:08:35,857 --> 01:08:40,294
...we get this heavy Indian thing going,
very rhythmic.

1118
01:08:43,732 --> 01:08:47,725
Derek, give me a beat:
steamy and sticky.

1119
01:08:54,376 --> 01:08:57,937
Way back into love

1120
01:08:58,113 --> 01:09:02,345
She's been living
With a shadow overhead

1121
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:10,550
She's been sleeping
With a cloud above her bed

1122
01:09:13,962 --> 01:09:16,522
Go Cora, go Cora

1123
01:09:17,866 --> 01:09:23,304
Cora Corman and Alex Fletcher
Got a new song that's gonna getcha

1124
01:09:23,471 --> 01:09:27,032
Way back into love

1125
01:09:27,208 --> 01:09:30,974
Way back into love

1126
01:09:32,347 --> 01:09:35,942
Way back into love

1127
01:09:38,987 --> 01:09:42,582
You know, I think that I will get
some wheatgrass after all.

1128
01:09:44,859 --> 01:09:47,555
- You don't like it?
- No. No, no, no, it's not that.

1129
01:09:47,729 --> 01:09:50,163
She had her eye on that wheatgrass
since we came in.

1130
01:09:50,331 --> 01:09:52,424
What you're doing,
that thing there, is great.

1131
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,899
It's steamy and it's sticky, you know.

1132
01:09:56,071 --> 01:09:59,097
Which is-- One is normally enough,
but the combo's just amazing.

1133
01:09:59,274 --> 01:10:00,707
C, time for the press shoot.

1134
01:10:01,209 --> 01:10:03,006
I really like what we came up with.

1135
01:10:03,711 --> 01:10:07,010
Oh, and add another verse.
It doesn't feel like the song ends yet.

1136
01:10:07,182 --> 01:10:09,343
Another verse? Right.
That would be an honor, C.

1137
01:10:09,517 --> 01:10:12,281
I'm having a little pre-recording session
party at my place.

1138
01:10:12,454 --> 01:10:14,479
I want you both to come.

1139
01:10:15,056 --> 01:10:16,182
Great.

1140
01:10:16,357 --> 01:10:19,258
I think though, that--
That there-- But wait--

1141
01:10:19,461 --> 01:10:21,361
Cheers. Thanks a lot, Ray.

1142
01:10:21,529 --> 01:10:23,997
Thanks, Derek. Nice one.

1143
01:10:24,165 --> 01:10:26,725
Don't speak. Don't say anything.

1144
01:10:28,736 --> 01:10:32,570
You didn't actually like that orgasm
set to the Gandhi soundtrack, did you?

1145
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:35,766
Well, I thought it was,
you know, horrible.

1146
01:10:35,944 --> 01:10:40,005
I mean, it simultaneously destroyed
two musical cultures in under a minute.

1147
01:10:40,181 --> 01:10:41,307
We have to tell her.

1148
01:10:41,483 --> 01:10:42,973
No, no. I don't think we do.

1149
01:10:43,151 --> 01:10:45,381
Honestly, if she wants to dance,
let her dance.

1150
01:10:45,553 --> 01:10:48,613
I don't understand. Wait. I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

1151
01:10:48,790 --> 01:10:53,090
Your heroes, the Beatles, Smokey,
they would never let this happen.

1152
01:10:53,261 --> 01:10:55,821
That's a completely different thing.
They were geniuses.

1153
01:10:55,997 --> 01:10:58,591
They wrote dinner. I write dessert.

1154
01:10:58,766 --> 01:11:00,597
No. You're better than dessert.

1155
01:11:00,768 --> 01:11:03,328
That's why I'm gonna tell her
what I think at the party.

1156
01:11:03,505 --> 01:11:05,268
- You are not gonna do that.
- Yes, I am.

1157
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:06,737
- No, you are not.
- Yes, I am.

1158
01:11:06,908 --> 01:11:09,001
In that case, you are no longer invited.

1159
01:11:09,177 --> 01:11:11,475
What? She invited me.

1160
01:11:11,646 --> 01:11:13,136
She invited us, as a team.

1161
01:11:13,314 --> 01:11:16,078
Now that we disagree,
we no longer present a united front...

1162
01:11:16,251 --> 01:11:19,049
...and are thus un-teamed
for the purposes of the invitation.

1163
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:20,209
So are you going?

1164
01:11:20,388 --> 01:11:23,289
- I might. I don't wanna be rude.
- I don't wanna be rude either.

1165
01:11:23,458 --> 01:11:25,517
You don't think that telling the hostess...

1166
01:11:25,693 --> 01:11:28,321
...that she's destroyed
two musical cultures is rude?

1167
01:11:28,496 --> 01:11:30,088
I'm enrolling you in charm school.

1168
01:11:30,265 --> 01:11:32,893
I have to say what I think.
I can't work this way.

1169
01:11:33,067 --> 01:11:35,968
You can't work this way?
You've been a songwriter for six days.

1170
01:11:36,137 --> 01:11:37,900
God created the universe in six days.

1171
01:11:38,072 --> 01:11:42,304
And he never had a hit. Okay, he did.
He had "He's Got the Whole World in..."

1172
01:11:42,477 --> 01:11:43,967
I'm going to the party.

1173
01:11:44,145 --> 01:11:47,205
You are not going to the party.
You, young lady, are grounded.

1174
01:11:47,382 --> 01:11:49,612
You're grounded. Come back here.

1175
01:11:49,784 --> 01:11:53,117
- Please. I'm a little bit desperate. Please.
- I'll see you there.

1176
01:11:53,288 --> 01:11:57,156
You won't. You won't because
you're not invited. They won't let you in.

1177
01:12:11,573 --> 01:12:13,734
- Hey, Ray.
- Alex, my man.

1178
01:12:13,908 --> 01:12:16,172
- How are you?
- I'm good, man. How you doing?

1179
01:12:16,344 --> 01:12:17,606
So is Sophie here?

1180
01:12:17,779 --> 01:12:20,373
You know what?
I haven't seen her. Yeah.

1181
01:12:20,548 --> 01:12:21,913
- Chris?
- Who?

1182
01:12:22,083 --> 01:12:24,313
- You know, my manager.
- I'm sorry. Have fun.

1183
01:12:24,485 --> 01:12:27,613
- Yeah.
- Hey, Michelle. Good to see you, babe.

1184
01:12:27,789 --> 01:12:28,778
Hey, how's it going?

1185
01:12:33,728 --> 01:12:35,593
Hey, Ray, what's up, man?

1186
01:12:36,130 --> 01:12:37,757
How's it going?

1187
01:13:03,224 --> 01:13:04,213
Hey.

1188
01:13:04,392 --> 01:13:05,723
- Where's Sophie?
- Hang on.

1189
01:13:06,327 --> 01:13:09,990
Hang on. God, she's here. Please
don't let her through. Don't let her through.

1190
01:13:10,164 --> 01:13:12,928
We cannot let her talk to Cora.
She's gonna ruin everything.

1191
01:13:13,101 --> 01:13:14,830
- Who?
- Sophie. She hates the song.

1192
01:13:15,003 --> 01:13:17,494
- She hates the song you wrote?
- Yes. She hates it.

1193
01:13:17,672 --> 01:13:20,869
But she wrote the song.
Why does she hate it?

1194
01:13:21,042 --> 01:13:23,476
We had a little disagreement.

1195
01:13:23,645 --> 01:13:25,237
Hi there, Soph, how are you?

1196
01:13:25,413 --> 01:13:27,643
- Hey, Sophie.
- Good evening.

1197
01:13:27,815 --> 01:13:30,648
So you brought something,
did you, Sophie?

1198
01:13:30,818 --> 01:13:33,616
Yes. My mother told me,
"Never go to a party empty-handed"...

1199
01:13:33,788 --> 01:13:38,248
...so I went to the Zen Eatery and got
a selection of cookies. No, thank you.

1200
01:13:38,426 --> 01:13:40,087
Nirvana Nougat.

1201
01:13:44,866 --> 01:13:47,027
Hey. It's my favorite writers.

1202
01:13:47,201 --> 01:13:48,532
Hi, C. How are you?

1203
01:13:48,703 --> 01:13:50,694
We brought you some cookies,
from all of us.

1204
01:13:51,272 --> 01:13:53,536
Thank you. Derek.

1205
01:13:53,708 --> 01:13:55,471
Cora, I really wanted to talk to you--

1206
01:13:55,643 --> 01:13:58,111
About the fact that
we're gonna have to leave early...

1207
01:13:58,279 --> 01:14:00,941
...to finish this song
which has become important to us...

1208
01:14:01,115 --> 01:14:03,106
...in both an artistic and spiritual sense.

1209
01:14:03,284 --> 01:14:05,514
You can't leave yet. Come see the house.

1210
01:14:05,687 --> 01:14:08,815
I wanna show you the roof. It's upstairs.

1211
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:11,185
Do you know--? Well...

1212
01:14:13,928 --> 01:14:18,365
Cora, I definitely see how much
you've thought about the song and--

1213
01:14:18,533 --> 01:14:21,866
Great roof. In a very interesting place
as well, right at the top--

1214
01:14:22,036 --> 01:14:25,494
- Sophie was about to say something.
- Was she? I don't think she was. No.

1215
01:14:25,673 --> 01:14:28,699
She looks like she's about
to say something, then just... clams up.

1216
01:14:28,876 --> 01:14:33,279
What I wanted to say is that I appreciate
that you're bringing thought to the music...

1217
01:14:33,448 --> 01:14:37,282
...but I really and honestly feel
that we're pandering.

1218
01:14:39,654 --> 01:14:43,385
Which means trying to make others like you,
which I think is a really nice thing.

1219
01:14:43,558 --> 01:14:46,254
I do a lot of it.
"Just going out pandering, be back soon."

1220
01:14:46,427 --> 01:14:50,830
The song is about the struggle, you know,
to show your true feelings.

1221
01:14:50,998 --> 01:14:53,933
And your very confident sexual display...

1222
01:14:54,102 --> 01:14:58,095
...is, you know, a total contradiction
of the fear and insecurity.

1223
01:14:58,272 --> 01:15:01,435
No, I don't think so.
And my fans really love it when I dance.

1224
01:15:01,609 --> 01:15:03,907
- You're a wonderful dancer.
- That's a fair point.

1225
01:15:04,078 --> 01:15:07,445
- My last CD only went to number two.
- But in this case, if you trust us--

1226
01:15:07,615 --> 01:15:11,244
And Shakira is breathing down my neck.
So I wanna dance.

1227
01:15:13,287 --> 01:15:15,551
You shall dance.

1228
01:15:16,190 --> 01:15:20,490
But thank you for your honesty, Sophie.
Cherish your passion.

1229
01:15:20,661 --> 01:15:24,529
- Well, thank you.
- Cora, Timberlake's here. Wants to say hi.

1230
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:26,596
Nice to see you, C. Talk to you later.

1231
01:15:26,768 --> 01:15:29,032
And I'm looking forward
to the new last verse.

1232
01:15:29,203 --> 01:15:30,397
- Cora, wait.
- It's over.

1233
01:15:30,571 --> 01:15:33,165
It was a very nice try,
but you have hit the karmic wall.

1234
01:15:33,341 --> 01:15:37,402
With no help from you.
You just stood there. Talk about pandering.

1235
01:15:37,578 --> 01:15:40,240
I did not pander. I just told her
what she wanted to hear.

1236
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:42,815
- I'm gonna go tell her the truth.
- You just did.

1237
01:15:42,984 --> 01:15:45,578
Are you gonna use flash cards this time?
You're stubborn.

1238
01:15:45,753 --> 01:15:48,722
And you're not stubborn enough
to stand up for what's good.

1239
01:15:48,890 --> 01:15:52,121
I mean, I just don't wanna see you
do what you did on your solo album.

1240
01:15:52,293 --> 01:15:53,624
Yes, yes, yes.

1241
01:15:55,096 --> 01:15:57,564
I bought it. The last copy.

1242
01:15:58,466 --> 01:16:01,060
All right, well, I insist
on paying you back immediately.

1243
01:16:01,235 --> 01:16:02,668
9.99, right? Do you have a penny?

1244
01:16:02,837 --> 01:16:05,499
You were trying so hard to get a hit
that it wasn't you.

1245
01:16:05,673 --> 01:16:07,766
The songs were soulless.

1246
01:16:07,942 --> 01:16:10,570
I agree. But ours has soul, so...

1247
01:16:10,745 --> 01:16:14,078
But not if we ruin it. And you know that.
Why are you so scared to care?

1248
01:16:14,248 --> 01:16:16,341
Because it won't matter.

1249
01:16:16,517 --> 01:16:20,419
Because behind
all her Buddhism-in-a-thong philosophy...

1250
01:16:20,588 --> 01:16:23,853
...what she cares about
is seats filled and units sold.

1251
01:16:24,025 --> 01:16:25,686
Nothing's gonna make her your pal...

1252
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:28,158
...any more than years with Colin
made him mine.

1253
01:16:28,329 --> 01:16:30,763
Because in the end, it's all just business.

1254
01:16:30,932 --> 01:16:32,832
- What is?
- All of it. Everything.

1255
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,968
That's why they call it
the music business.

1256
01:16:35,136 --> 01:16:37,900
It's a good thing.
I wish everything in life was that clear.

1257
01:16:38,072 --> 01:16:40,540
I want something from you,
you want something from me.

1258
01:16:40,708 --> 01:16:42,232
No false promises or expectations.

1259
01:16:45,847 --> 01:16:47,314
Well.

1260
01:16:47,482 --> 01:16:49,712
Congratulations on your feel-good song.

1261
01:16:52,553 --> 01:16:54,077
Can I get you a drink?

1262
01:17:21,582 --> 01:17:24,551
There's plenty of time.
We have the night, part of the morning...

1263
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:26,619
...teeniest little bit of the afternoon.

1264
01:17:56,150 --> 01:17:58,641
I can't read it.
What does that--? What does that say?

1265
01:17:59,387 --> 01:18:01,287
"Sorry, I can't do this."

1266
01:18:06,394 --> 01:18:10,330
Sorry, I can't do this

1267
01:18:11,866 --> 01:18:15,302
Not sure about the scansion.
What--? What, are you leaving?

1268
01:18:15,469 --> 01:18:19,667
Yeah. I'm sorry.
Maybe I'll think of something later.

1269
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:22,502
There is no later.
She needs the song tomorrow.

1270
01:18:22,677 --> 01:18:25,612
If we don't give it to her,
she's gonna go to someone else.

1271
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:27,145
I will have lost the job.

1272
01:18:27,315 --> 01:18:29,442
I'm sorry.

1273
01:18:30,251 --> 01:18:32,981
- Okay, look.
- No, I want to help. I do.

1274
01:18:33,154 --> 01:18:35,452
I wanna help you finish, but I can't.

1275
01:18:35,623 --> 01:18:39,923
I can't write when I feel like this.
I'm not inspired.

1276
01:18:40,094 --> 01:18:44,463
I don't care. I don't care if you're inspired.
Inspiration's for amateurs.

1277
01:18:44,632 --> 01:18:48,124
I just want four lines. Please.
I just want four lines.

1278
01:18:48,302 --> 01:18:51,169
- I can't.
- Oh, but you can and you won't.

1279
01:18:51,339 --> 01:18:54,706
- Are you saying I wanted this to happen?
- I'm saying that's what you do.

1280
01:18:54,875 --> 01:18:57,207
You push and push
and move the furniture around...

1281
01:18:57,378 --> 01:18:59,073
...and talk all the time...

1282
01:18:59,246 --> 01:19:01,680
...and screw everything up
just like he said.

1283
01:19:02,149 --> 01:19:04,811
Who's he? What are you talking about?
What are you saying?

1284
01:19:04,986 --> 01:19:07,750
I read the book because I wanted
to come to you and say:

1285
01:19:07,922 --> 01:19:11,653
"You're not at all like Sally Michaels."
But actually, he's got you spot on.

1286
01:19:11,826 --> 01:19:15,387
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying Sloan Cates was right.

1287
01:19:16,464 --> 01:19:20,457
Oh, my God. Please take that back.

1288
01:19:20,635 --> 01:19:24,093
The poor, innocent, helpless
"'I can't write,' she says to herself" girl...

1289
01:19:24,271 --> 01:19:26,296
...has co-authored
three-quarters of a hit...

1290
01:19:26,474 --> 01:19:29,602
...and is holding it ransom
because she can't get what she wants.

1291
01:19:29,777 --> 01:19:33,235
You think life is this fairy tale.

1292
01:19:33,414 --> 01:19:37,043
When it turns out that everything
doesn't end happily, you can't deal with it.

1293
01:19:58,305 --> 01:20:03,607
Mama says I can't, Daddy says I can
But now my body just wants to slam

1294
01:20:04,879 --> 01:20:06,403
Slam

1295
01:20:07,381 --> 01:20:10,748
- C, Alex Fletcher is here.
- Hey, Alex.

1296
01:20:11,218 --> 01:20:14,449
C, could I--? Could I have a quick word?
Thanks a lot.

1297
01:20:14,822 --> 01:20:17,222
- Derek, how are you? Good to see you.
- Alex Fletcher.

1298
01:20:20,261 --> 01:20:22,354
Yo, so how's my girl Sophie, man?

1299
01:20:22,530 --> 01:20:25,158
Yeah, no, she's keeping it pretty real.

1300
01:20:25,332 --> 01:20:27,027
Yeah, what a girl.

1301
01:20:27,201 --> 01:20:31,262
C, hi. Listen, it's about
the new last verse.

1302
01:20:31,439 --> 01:20:34,499
It's not completely formed
in the classical sense yet.

1303
01:20:34,675 --> 01:20:38,133
It's more a kind of string of words
that you can connect in almost any way.

1304
01:20:38,312 --> 01:20:40,576
- I think it's quite innovative.
- I got the lyrics.

1305
01:20:40,748 --> 01:20:44,479
Sophie faxed them over this morning.
They are so beautiful.

1306
01:20:44,652 --> 01:20:46,916
It's what I always wanted to say
to my boyfriend.

1307
01:20:47,088 --> 01:20:49,921
It's the perfect end to the song.

1308
01:20:50,291 --> 01:20:54,921
There are moments
When I don't know if it's real

1309
01:20:55,096 --> 01:20:59,931
Or if anybody feels the way I feel

1310
01:21:00,101 --> 01:21:03,161
I need inspiration

1311
01:21:03,938 --> 01:21:09,672
Not just another negotiation

1312
01:21:11,312 --> 01:21:16,648
All I wanna do
Is find a way back into...

1313
01:21:17,818 --> 01:21:20,378
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, yeah. Sorry, sorry.

1314
01:21:20,554 --> 01:21:23,648
I just-- I just completely,
I don't know, spaced out.

1315
01:21:23,824 --> 01:21:26,554
That's okay. Let's take it from the top
with the new intro.

1316
01:21:26,727 --> 01:21:28,524
Yep. Great.

1317
01:21:30,431 --> 01:21:34,527
Yeah, Cora Corman and Alex Fletcher

1318
01:21:34,702 --> 01:21:36,693
Way back into love

1319
01:21:42,343 --> 01:21:43,332
Hi.

1320
01:21:43,978 --> 01:21:45,536
Hello.

1321
01:21:46,247 --> 01:21:50,149
I bought these for your children because
one should never show up empty-handed.

1322
01:21:50,718 --> 01:21:55,087
They're aliens.
Clearly, I have no children. Here.

1323
01:21:55,256 --> 01:21:58,054
- Here, let me get that for you.
- Thank you.

1324
01:22:01,195 --> 01:22:04,687
I am gonna go to the office.

1325
01:22:05,299 --> 01:22:08,063
- I am too. Have fun with those.
- Bye.

1326
01:22:14,375 --> 01:22:16,639
Put them there, thanks.

1327
01:22:18,679 --> 01:22:20,408
You coming to the concert tomorrow?

1328
01:22:20,848 --> 01:22:22,907
Can't disappoint Lucy.

1329
01:22:23,083 --> 01:22:25,278
Yes, yes, very important.

1330
01:22:26,187 --> 01:22:30,851
Chris is bringing his daughter as well,
so should be fun.

1331
01:22:31,192 --> 01:22:34,127
I just wanted to say
I thought your last verse was fantastic.

1332
01:22:34,562 --> 01:22:35,551
Thank you, Alex.

1333
01:22:36,530 --> 01:22:38,862
And I'm very sorry about what I said.

1334
01:22:39,033 --> 01:22:42,662
Well, you know, life isn't a fairy tale
and I have to grow up...

1335
01:22:42,837 --> 01:22:44,702
...and I'm gonna do that in Florida.

1336
01:22:45,372 --> 01:22:47,340
Well, that's just ridiculous.

1337
01:22:47,508 --> 01:22:50,773
No one grows up in Florida.
Unless they're an orange.

1338
01:22:50,945 --> 01:22:53,743
Well, I'm managing
the new Weight-Not branch in Boca Raton.

1339
01:22:53,914 --> 01:22:56,576
You should be writing,
not fighting cellulite.

1340
01:22:56,750 --> 01:22:59,310
Well, I can do both.
We need a new marketing campaign.

1341
01:22:59,486 --> 01:23:01,249
Swimsuit season is coming up.

1342
01:23:02,823 --> 01:23:04,415
Thing is...

1343
01:23:05,826 --> 01:23:07,919
...I can't...

1344
01:23:11,498 --> 01:23:13,796
...compose without you.

1345
01:23:13,968 --> 01:23:16,835
Thanks, but I don't think
it's a good idea.

1346
01:23:21,709 --> 01:23:23,574
All right. You're obviously very busy.

1347
01:23:29,016 --> 01:23:30,608
Good luck.

1348
01:23:31,452 --> 01:23:32,749
You too.

1349
01:25:20,027 --> 01:25:21,688
Cora!

1350
01:25:26,166 --> 01:25:28,896
- Gracie, aren't you excited?
- Let's go.

1351
01:25:30,604 --> 01:25:34,597
You know what? You guys, just go.
I think I'm gonna skip it.

1352
01:25:34,775 --> 01:25:37,243
- No, come on. You can't skip it.
- You know what, kids?

1353
01:25:37,411 --> 01:25:39,879
I'm gonna talk to your aunt, okay?
Gary, take them in.

1354
01:25:40,047 --> 01:25:42,072
- Should I meet you--?
- Do it. How hard is it?

1355
01:25:42,249 --> 01:25:43,739
- Go, walk, sit.
- Find your seats.

1356
01:25:43,917 --> 01:25:46,852
Honey, I need a second. Thank you.
Love you. You're a good man.

1357
01:25:47,021 --> 01:25:48,215
Now, listen to me.

1358
01:25:48,389 --> 01:25:52,951
Those kids have told all of their friends
that their aunt wrote Cora's new hit song.

1359
01:25:53,127 --> 01:25:55,721
And they wanna share this with you.
You gotta go in.

1360
01:25:55,896 --> 01:25:58,831
Yeah. No, I know. I know. I just...

1361
01:25:58,999 --> 01:26:02,730
I don't know how I'm gonna go in there
and look at him.

1362
01:26:03,937 --> 01:26:07,134
I know. It's just one night, though,
and I really think you need this.

1363
01:26:07,307 --> 01:26:11,835
And then he'll go his way
and you'll go yours. Okay?

1364
01:26:16,450 --> 01:26:18,680
Do you have her autograph?

1365
01:26:18,852 --> 01:26:20,114
- Isn't this exciting?
- Yeah.

1366
01:26:20,721 --> 01:26:21,745
This is so cool.

1367
01:26:22,556 --> 01:26:25,423
- Yeah, weirdo. This is so cool.
- It's great.

1368
01:26:25,592 --> 01:26:27,924
We're in the Cora fan club.
Can we? Please, Mom?

1369
01:26:28,095 --> 01:26:30,791
- Okay.
- Cora!

1370
01:26:52,653 --> 01:26:54,587
Cora!

1371
01:26:54,755 --> 01:26:55,983
Cora!

1372
01:27:06,533 --> 01:27:08,194
Cora!

1373
01:27:32,793 --> 01:27:36,024
- Look, there she is!
- Is that Cora?

1374
01:27:52,546 --> 01:27:53,945
I'm starting to believe, boy

1375
01:27:55,115 --> 01:27:56,548
That this was meant to be, boy

1376
01:27:56,717 --> 01:27:59,379
'Cause I believe in karma

1377
01:27:59,553 --> 01:28:02,021
Boy, do you believe in karma?

1378
01:28:04,892 --> 01:28:08,851
Each time you put your lips to mine
It's like a taste of Buddha's delight

1379
01:28:09,029 --> 01:28:14,763
- Hey, Gary.
- Come on. I'm just watching.

1380
01:28:15,903 --> 01:28:18,895
Tell me all your fantasies tonight

1381
01:28:19,072 --> 01:28:20,664
And I will make them happen 'cause

1382
01:28:20,841 --> 01:28:25,369
I'm not satisfied if I don't get

1383
01:28:25,546 --> 01:28:27,912
My Buddha's delight

1384
01:28:28,649 --> 01:28:31,379
Om shanti, shanti

1385
01:28:33,487 --> 01:28:38,982
This Tuesday on The CW,
it's Battle of the '80s Has-Beens...

1386
01:28:39,159 --> 01:28:42,390
...featuring Tiffany battling
reigning champion Debbie Gibson...

1387
01:28:42,563 --> 01:28:45,225
...followed by a bout
between Adam Ant and Billy Idol.

1388
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:48,966
Tuesday night on The CW.

1389
01:28:50,370 --> 01:28:52,702
Five minutes, Mr. Fletcher.

1390
01:28:55,342 --> 01:28:59,938
Entering Bootytown
So shake my booty now

1391
01:29:00,113 --> 01:29:05,710
'Cause your booty
Is the way into his heart

1392
01:29:20,033 --> 01:29:22,194
New York, I love you!

1393
01:29:24,438 --> 01:29:25,700
Shanti, shanti.

1394
01:29:25,872 --> 01:29:27,066
What's that mean?

1395
01:29:27,241 --> 01:29:30,176
And now I'd like you to hear
something very special.

1396
01:29:30,344 --> 01:29:33,370
- Oh, Soph.
- Something very different.

1397
01:29:33,547 --> 01:29:35,014
It's a new song.

1398
01:29:35,182 --> 01:29:37,173
This is it, weirdo, your song.

1399
01:29:38,418 --> 01:29:41,819
- I don't think I can listen to this.
- A song no one has heard before...

1400
01:29:41,989 --> 01:29:45,618
...written by Mr. Alex Fletcher.

1401
01:29:45,792 --> 01:29:46,781
Wait.

1402
01:29:52,799 --> 01:29:55,927
What? Alex Fletcher and my sister.

1403
01:29:56,103 --> 01:29:57,502
How quickly they forget.

1404
01:29:58,705 --> 01:30:01,538
Let's just go and come back
when the song's over. You and me.

1405
01:30:03,810 --> 01:30:05,641
- Actually, I'm gonna go.
- No. What?

1406
01:30:05,812 --> 01:30:07,837
- Yeah, no. I'm fine. Just...
- Are you sure?

1407
01:30:08,015 --> 01:30:11,246
Yeah, I'm fine. I just wanna be alone.
Just take care of the kids.

1408
01:30:32,339 --> 01:30:35,069
It's never been easy for me

1409
01:30:36,877 --> 01:30:40,608
To find words to go along with a melody

1410
01:30:43,750 --> 01:30:48,119
But this time there's actually
Something on my mind

1411
01:30:50,157 --> 01:30:54,753
So please forgive
These few brief awkward lines

1412
01:30:56,930 --> 01:31:00,923
Since I met you
My whole life has changed

1413
01:31:03,337 --> 01:31:07,865
It's not just my furniture
You've rearranged

1414
01:31:10,043 --> 01:31:15,743
I was living in the past
But somehow you've brought me back

1415
01:31:16,249 --> 01:31:21,744
And I haven't felt like this
Since before Frankie said, "Relax"

1416
01:31:21,922 --> 01:31:24,413
And though I know

1417
01:31:24,591 --> 01:31:27,560
Based on my track record

1418
01:31:27,728 --> 01:31:30,720
I might not seem like the safest bet

1419
01:31:34,167 --> 01:31:36,431
All I'm asking you

1420
01:31:37,003 --> 01:31:40,905
Is don't write me off just yet

1421
01:31:52,419 --> 01:31:56,412
For years I've been telling myself
The same old story

1422
01:31:58,625 --> 01:32:03,187
That I'm happy to live off
My so-called former glories

1423
01:32:05,065 --> 01:32:11,004
But you've given me a reason
To take another chance

1424
01:32:11,505 --> 01:32:16,966
Now I need you despite the fact
That you've killed all my plants

1425
01:32:17,310 --> 01:32:19,369
And though I know

1426
01:32:19,546 --> 01:32:22,572
I've already blown more chances

1427
01:32:22,749 --> 01:32:25,775
Than anyone should ever get

1428
01:32:29,689 --> 01:32:32,180
All I'm asking you

1429
01:32:32,359 --> 01:32:36,125
Is don't write me off just yet

1430
01:32:39,399 --> 01:32:43,961
Don't write me off just yet

1431
01:33:01,555 --> 01:33:03,182
Alex!

1432
01:33:25,212 --> 01:33:27,772
- Nobody backstage.
- I have to get up there. I know Cora.

1433
01:33:27,948 --> 01:33:30,746
- I don't care what you want.
- I know Cora. I wrote this song.

1434
01:33:30,917 --> 01:33:31,906
She's okay.

1435
01:33:32,085 --> 01:33:34,519
- There's nobody backstage.
- I said she's okay, right?

1436
01:33:34,688 --> 01:33:36,679
- Well, you vouch for her, then.
- Thank you.

1437
01:33:36,857 --> 01:33:37,949
What's wrong with you?

1438
01:33:38,124 --> 01:33:40,649
As soon as Cora's done "Slam,"
we'll need you on-stage.

1439
01:33:40,827 --> 01:33:43,261
Okay, got it. Got it.
Thanks very much. Cheers.

1440
01:33:44,898 --> 01:33:46,923
Slam

1441
01:33:47,534 --> 01:33:52,938
Mama says I can't, Daddy says I can
But now my body just wants to slam

1442
01:33:54,241 --> 01:33:55,401
Slam

1443
01:33:57,344 --> 01:33:59,209
Come to a concert, don't bring anything?

1444
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:02,874
Alex, that song.

1445
01:34:03,049 --> 01:34:06,314
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.
It's the best I could do. You could fix it.

1446
01:34:06,486 --> 01:34:09,580
No. That song was dinner.

1447
01:34:13,059 --> 01:34:15,323
Mama says I can't, Daddy says I can

1448
01:34:18,832 --> 01:34:19,958
Thank you!

1449
01:34:23,503 --> 01:34:26,563
I want you to hear my new single.

1450
01:34:27,407 --> 01:34:29,136
Thank you!

1451
01:34:29,309 --> 01:34:34,076
"Way Back Into Love," music and lyrics
by Sophie Fisher and Alex Fletcher.

1452
01:34:34,247 --> 01:34:36,715
What happened to steamy and sticky?

1453
01:34:36,883 --> 01:34:39,909
I explained to Cora that it violated
the very core of the lyric...

1454
01:34:40,086 --> 01:34:41,951
...and corrupted the purity of the song.

1455
01:34:42,122 --> 01:34:45,057
When that didn't work, I told her
it would help me win you back.

1456
01:34:45,225 --> 01:34:46,487
And that did it.

1457
01:34:46,660 --> 01:34:50,994
Turns out that although she thought
the Dalai Lama was, incredibly, a Ilama...

1458
01:34:51,164 --> 01:34:53,359
...she is, in fact, quite the romantic.

1459
01:34:54,100 --> 01:34:56,000
- Go. Go. Go.
- Okay, Mr. Fletcher.

1460
01:34:56,169 --> 01:34:57,636
Thank you.

1461
01:34:57,804 --> 01:35:03,003
Trapped in the past
I just can't seem to move on

1462
01:35:03,176 --> 01:35:07,704
I've been hiding all my hopes
And dreams away

1463
01:35:07,881 --> 01:35:12,682
Just in case I ever need 'em
Again someday

1464
01:35:12,852 --> 01:35:15,844
I've been setting aside time

1465
01:35:16,856 --> 01:35:21,987
To clear a little space
In the corners of my mind

1466
01:35:22,996 --> 01:35:28,992
All I wanna do
Is find a way back into love

1467
01:35:32,672 --> 01:35:39,635
I can't make it through
Without a way back into love

1468
01:35:46,319 --> 01:35:50,813
I've been watching
But the stars refuse to shine

1469
01:35:50,991 --> 01:35:55,826
I've been searching
But I just don't see the signs

1470
01:35:55,996 --> 01:35:59,727
I know that it's out there

1471
01:35:59,899 --> 01:36:05,166
There's gotta be something
For my soul somewhere

1472
01:36:05,338 --> 01:36:09,536
I've been looking for someone
To shed some light

1473
01:36:09,709 --> 01:36:14,009
Not somebody just to get me
Through the night

1474
01:36:14,381 --> 01:36:17,407
I could use some direction

1475
01:36:19,219 --> 01:36:23,315
And I'm open to your suggestions

1476
01:36:24,190 --> 01:36:30,857
All I wanna do
Is find a way back into love

1477
01:36:33,566 --> 01:36:40,096
I can't make it through
Without a way back into love

1478
01:36:41,207 --> 01:36:45,576
And if I open my heart to you

1479
01:36:45,745 --> 01:36:50,148
I'm hoping you'll show me what to do

1480
01:36:50,316 --> 01:36:54,480
And if you help me to start again

1481
01:36:55,588 --> 01:37:02,494
You know that I'll be there
For you in the end
