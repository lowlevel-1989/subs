1
00:00:39,531 --> 00:00:40,802
The Dragon Ball's,

2
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,052
a legend as old as time itself,

3
00:00:43,082 --> 00:00:46,951
forged in the eternal flames that
stir deep within the earth's core.

4
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:49,688
At the heart of these
flames dwells Shenron.

5
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:51,139
The Eternal Dragon.

6
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,742
Custodian of the 7 Dragon Balls
scattered throughout the world.

7
00:00:54,867 --> 00:00:57,485
If it is said that once
all seven are united.

8
00:00:57,515 --> 00:01:01,236
The Mighty Shenron will
grant the holder a single wish.

9
00:01:01,237 --> 00:01:04,958
Afterwords the balls will once
more be scattered across the earth.

10
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,614
While the eternal
dragon returns to his lair

11
00:01:07,684 --> 00:01:13,233
until another brave or foolish
soul reunites the magical orbs.

Pansy!

40
00:04:04,237 --> 00:04:06,576
- I'm just doing my job!
- Pansy! You mustn't.

41
00:04:06,577 --> 00:04:08,296
Why you little!

42
00:04:11,856 --> 00:04:14,376
She's only a child. Leave her be.

43
00:04:15,992 --> 00:04:18,323
Let go of my rifle peasant!

44
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,033
Pick on someone your own size.

45
00:04:24,142 --> 00:04:25,500
What's going on?!

46
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:30,266
Bongo, this vermin attacked me!

47
00:04:30,297 --> 00:04:33,096
Oh, are you really that anxious to die?

48
00:04:33,097 --> 00:04:35,363
If that's what it takes
to protect my daughter.

49
00:04:35,394 --> 00:04:38,334
The king has destroyed our crops and our...

50
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:48,607
The Blood Rubies beneath your worthless land
are the only crop that interest the king.

51
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:52,015
You think those stones give
you the right to trample us

52
00:04:52,045 --> 00:04:53,686
and turn our farms into wastelands.

53
00:04:53,717 --> 00:04:54,992
But no more!

54
00:04:57,414 --> 00:04:59,167
You've got a mouth on you farmer.

55
00:04:59,277 --> 00:05:01,066
Boldness deserves a reward.

56
00:05:13,222 --> 00:05:14,285
Back off!

57
00:05:17,647 --> 00:05:19,087
- Alston!
- Papa!

58
00:05:19,447 --> 00:05:21,527
- Wake up wake up!
- I love my work.

59
00:05:21,614 --> 00:05:24,270
It's important to choose
a career you enjoy.

60
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:30,183
- To the palace.
- Right!

61
00:05:32,357 --> 00:05:33,900
I could've taken him.

62
00:05:33,997 --> 00:05:37,427
This isn't like King Gurumes!
These bullies must've tricked him.

63
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:40,267
I'll show um.

64
00:05:40,706 --> 00:05:42,823
They're messing around with the wrong kid.

65
00:05:55,413 --> 00:05:57,483
You call this food!?

66
00:05:57,714 --> 00:06:01,214
Not just me, everyone calls it food.

67
00:06:13,567 --> 00:06:14,954
I'm starving.

68
00:06:15,033 --> 00:06:16,415
I can't take it.

69
00:06:16,446 --> 00:06:18,373
Ever since I found the Blood Rubies.

70
00:06:18,603 --> 00:06:21,439
Nothing satisfies my ravenous hunger.

71
00:06:24,786 --> 00:06:27,867
Pasta, you bring good news I trust?

72
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:29,206
Yes, your majesty,

73
00:06:29,338 --> 00:06:32,900
I believe that I may soon have another
Dragon Ball to add to your collection.

74
00:06:32,931 --> 00:06:35,967
Good, then I'll have five.

75
00:06:35,998 --> 00:06:38,583
Sire, this time we have competition.

76
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,200
Eh? Who?

77
00:06:41,363 --> 00:06:43,015
Fortune hunters.

78
00:06:46,894 --> 00:06:49,036
Fine! Go!

79
00:06:49,037 --> 00:06:50,605
So, what's in it for me?

80
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,800
Life, and rubies.

81
00:06:55,007 --> 00:06:58,017
All the Blood Rubies your
grubby mitts can carry.

82
00:06:58,353 --> 00:06:59,733
Bobbles are meaningless.

83
00:06:59,764 --> 00:07:02,737
I'll starve to death unless
this hunger can be abated.

84
00:07:02,768 --> 00:07:06,067
You think I'll be full
with all this food but no!

85
00:07:06,368 --> 00:07:10,399
I need all 7 balls to be able
to wish this hunger away!

86
00:07:10,593 --> 00:07:11,749
Look at me.

87
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,094
I can't fit into any of my old robes.

88
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,323
I've tried!

89
00:07:15,354 --> 00:07:17,021
Bring me the Dragon Balls!

90
00:07:17,052 --> 00:07:18,397
Now!

91
00:07:58,167 --> 00:08:00,501
Time to catch some food
grandpa. Wish me luck.

92
00:08:17,249 --> 00:08:18,367
Yeah!

93
00:08:20,973 --> 00:08:23,267
Lookout fishies Gokû coming!

94
00:08:48,715 --> 00:08:50,230
Ahh!

95
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,333
Doesn't look friendly.

96
00:09:03,695 --> 00:09:06,633
According to my radar
the Dragon Ball just ahead.

97
00:09:06,836 --> 00:09:08,008
It's mine!

98
00:09:08,866 --> 00:09:11,717
But to get it I may have to play nasty.

99
00:09:12,257 --> 00:09:13,800
We should be coming up on it now

100
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:15,621
Bering 5-0 Mark 9.

101
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,711
Must be inside that hut.

102
00:09:21,051 --> 00:09:23,767
The big bird and listen to it tummy growl.

103
00:09:24,048 --> 00:09:27,000
That's funny, it looks like it's
trying to land near my house.

104
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:29,789
Ahhh.

105
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:38,400
Eee, that's a big fish.

106
00:09:39,885 --> 00:09:42,948
Grr! Come out of your shell
monster! Fight me face to face!

107
00:09:42,979 --> 00:09:44,834
Were you planning to
eat that thing or name it?

108
00:09:44,865 --> 00:09:47,333
I know what you're up
to, you big old monster!

109
00:09:47,415 --> 00:09:49,174
You're trying to steal my lunch from me.

110
00:09:49,205 --> 00:09:51,910
Well if you want it, you're
going to have to fight me for it.

111
00:09:51,941 --> 00:09:52,580
Uh?

112
00:09:52,818 --> 00:09:57,185
Ahhh!

113
00:09:58,027 --> 00:09:59,220
Stay back!

114
00:10:02,118 --> 00:10:03,526
Ow! That stings!

115
00:10:03,557 --> 00:10:05,412
What do you have against
a fair fight anyway?

116
00:10:05,443 --> 00:10:08,473
Uh! I shot you 3 times!
How are you not dead?!

117
00:10:08,504 --> 00:10:10,908
Shot me! You got a strange way of fighting!

118
00:10:10,998 --> 00:10:14,298
It will take a lot more than some
dumb old rock shooter to kill me!

119
00:10:15,612 --> 00:10:18,152
Prepare to get beat you filthy monster!

120
00:10:18,183 --> 00:10:21,534
Hey! Now, I admit I have my bad
days but "monsters" a little harsh.

121
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:22,946
Ahh!

122
00:10:22,977 --> 00:10:24,977
I'M A HUMAN BEING!

123
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,067
You're human?

124
00:10:28,098 --> 00:10:29,001
Uh-huh.

125
00:10:29,322 --> 00:10:30,486
Don't look it.

126
00:10:30,772 --> 00:10:32,908
WANNA SEE A MONSTER, KEEP PUSHING!

127
00:10:35,757 --> 00:10:38,067
Like I said, I'm as human as you.

128
00:10:38,098 --> 00:10:41,008
If that's so, how come your legs
are so long and skinny looking?

129
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:42,636
You sure you're not some kind of stork?

130
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:44,167
I'm not a bird! I'm a girl!

131
00:10:44,198 --> 00:10:46,246
Something you'll figure
out in a couple of years.

132
00:10:46,277 --> 00:10:48,054
Girl! What's that?

133
00:10:48,268 --> 00:10:49,901
Or your case maybe not.

134
00:10:49,932 --> 00:10:51,878
You seriously never seen a girl before?

135
00:10:51,975 --> 00:10:54,586
The only other person I've
ever seen is my grandpa.

136
00:10:54,617 --> 00:10:57,117
And you don't look like him.
His chest bumps are bigger.

137
00:10:57,247 --> 00:10:58,907
Huh?

138
00:11:00,845 --> 00:11:03,081
Hey, that's grandpa's ball.

139
00:11:03,112 --> 00:11:03,988
Wha...?

140
00:11:05,215 --> 00:11:08,323
Stop! That's my Dragon
Ball you snake! Give it back!

141
00:11:08,354 --> 00:11:11,302
No, it isn't. This ball was my
grandpa's. He gave it to me!

142
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:14,278
Say, it must be your dragon
ball I saw on my radar.

143
00:11:14,331 --> 00:11:15,627
Dragon Ball? What's that?

144
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:19,880
I can prove it. Look closely at the red stars.
Each Dragon Ball has a different number.

145
00:11:19,911 --> 00:11:21,021
Yeah, you're right.

146
00:11:21,352 --> 00:11:25,100
My grandpa's has four stars
on it, but this one only has two.

147
00:11:28,338 --> 00:11:29,708
The fourth ball is ours.

148
00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:32,533
Gee, that was so easy
I'm almost disappointed.

149
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:34,800
Come on! Can't you run faster?

150
00:11:34,935 --> 00:11:36,618
I'm carrying a 200-pound fish.

151
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:39,790
Forget the fish! I got a feeling
somebody's after that Dragon Ball of yours.

152
00:11:39,821 --> 00:11:41,259
My ball!

153
00:11:41,632 --> 00:11:43,362
Hey, wait up!

154
00:11:59,372 --> 00:12:01,386
Is your grandpa's Dragon Ball still here.

155
00:12:01,483 --> 00:12:03,915
Um, it, it changed.

156
00:12:03,946 --> 00:12:05,649
It turned into a gold coin.

157
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,485
What?

158
00:12:08,152 --> 00:12:08,792
Oh.

159
00:12:09,073 --> 00:12:12,200
Oh, I should have known.
Those goons beat me to it.

160
00:12:20,883 --> 00:12:21,648
Huh?

161
00:12:29,173 --> 00:12:30,658
Great, they're getting away!

162
00:12:30,689 --> 00:12:31,857
The big bird took it?

163
00:12:31,888 --> 00:12:33,867
Boy you are a brick aren't you little guy.

164
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:36,800
That's not a bird, that's
a Royal Rocket Fighter.

165
00:12:37,634 --> 00:12:39,467
Kid, we gotta go after them.

166
00:12:39,498 --> 00:12:42,860
I want grandpa's ball back
but I don't know how to fly.

167
00:12:42,891 --> 00:12:43,859
Not a problem.

168
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,231
Let's see...

169
00:12:45,523 --> 00:12:47,130
It's number 5!

170
00:12:47,421 --> 00:12:48,633
Stand back!

171
00:12:52,631 --> 00:12:53,842
Yaah!

172
00:12:54,884 --> 00:12:56,129
Hurry! Let's go!

173
00:12:56,891 --> 00:12:57,987
Black magic!

174
00:12:58,285 --> 00:13:00,741
Y-Your a sorcerer aren't you?!

175
00:13:00,772 --> 00:13:03,167
Would you get with the
program? This isn't magic.

176
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,630
It's a hydro jet, there everywhere.

177
00:13:07,011 --> 00:13:10,210
Brother, those guys are gonna get
away if you don't stop messing around.

178
00:13:10,241 --> 00:13:11,539
Now come on let's go!

179
00:13:18,626 --> 00:13:19,774
Please, will ya.

180
00:13:19,805 --> 00:13:21,285
What's your name anyway?

181
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:22,139
Gokû.

182
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,186
I'm Bulma. Hold on to your tail,

183
00:13:24,264 --> 00:13:25,722
here we go!

184
00:13:28,244 --> 00:13:31,159
If this thing's so valuable
why not keep it ourselves.

185
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:34,445
Because Blood Rubies are more
valuable and we get to keep our heads.

186
00:13:34,476 --> 00:13:37,200
Where do you think King Gurumes
keeps the other Dragon Balls?

187
00:13:37,231 --> 00:13:38,161
I don't know.

188
00:13:38,288 --> 00:13:41,194
I suppose he'll share that
tidbit when we have all 7.

189
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,200
Set her down!

190
00:13:48,316 --> 00:13:49,918
Give us back our Dragon Ball!

191
00:13:49,949 --> 00:13:51,304
You left this at my house!

192
00:13:52,536 --> 00:13:55,479
Don't know what there saying but
we should definitely shoot them a reply.

193
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,185
Yeah, I don't get what
they are so sorry about,

194
00:13:57,215 --> 00:13:58,618
we paid them for the Dragon Ball,

195
00:13:58,648 --> 00:14:00,510
maybe they want a receipt.

196
00:14:11,677 --> 00:14:13,407
Guess they don't want to give it back.

197
00:14:16,534 --> 00:14:18,900
You can't get rid of me that easily.

198
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:30,564
Now it's my turn!

199
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:44,901
Bongo are we ok?

200
00:14:44,932 --> 00:14:46,323
We're losing fuel!

201
00:14:46,983 --> 00:14:48,633
This means war.

202
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,971
Yeah! Yeah!

203
00:14:53,388 --> 00:14:56,100
That's it... I got your payback right here.

204
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,473
Now!

205
00:15:14,444 --> 00:15:16,733
Aw, the sweet smell of victory.

206
00:15:22,751 --> 00:15:25,100
I hope you can swim 'cause I can't!

207
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,990
How come your dripping?
You didn't fall in the water.

208
00:15:44,331 --> 00:15:48,833
Ugh! Breathe a word
of this and I'll kill you.

209
00:15:57,449 --> 00:15:59,654
Thanks for your help
out there. I feel silly.

210
00:15:59,789 --> 00:16:02,753
I don't know what came over me.
It's not like that was my first crisis

211
00:16:02,784 --> 00:16:04,867
I'm so hungry...

212
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:24,727
Ahh!

213
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,939
Yahh!

214
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:33,931
Why you look sweet enough to eat.

215
00:16:35,352 --> 00:16:36,800
Stay back!

216
00:16:36,907 --> 00:16:37,947
Oww!

217
00:16:37,978 --> 00:16:40,018
- You coulda' poke my eye out!
- Somebody help me!

218
00:16:40,048 --> 00:16:41,748
Please help me!

219
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,898
Calm down I won't eat you.

220
00:16:43,929 --> 00:16:45,588
It's a figure of speech.

221
00:16:46,431 --> 00:16:48,784
Help! He's trying to eat me!

222
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,458
Ahh!

223
00:16:50,503 --> 00:16:52,149
Monster!

224
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:55,412
Looks like I got a full course meal.

225
00:16:55,773 --> 00:16:57,267
I don't think so.

226
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,832
Beat it, you rat boy.

227
00:16:58,913 --> 00:16:59,985
You beat it!

228
00:17:00,147 --> 00:17:01,352
My grandpa taught me

229
00:17:01,382 --> 00:17:04,300
it's not right for anyone to bully
people smaller than they are!

230
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:06,600
He's nuts!

231
00:17:08,105 --> 00:17:09,585
Big words little runt.

232
00:17:09,615 --> 00:17:11,986
Right or wrong you are smaller than me

233
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,933
I could eat you and
your furry tail in one gulp.

234
00:17:14,984 --> 00:17:17,430
Ahhh!

235
00:17:18,146 --> 00:17:19,793
Kinda gives you chills, don't it?

236
00:17:19,933 --> 00:17:21,800
Not really, bring it!

237
00:17:23,063 --> 00:17:24,533
Maybe this will!

238
00:17:30,221 --> 00:17:32,221
Hope you like playing the hero.

239
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:37,359
'Cause I'll happily dip you in this hot
soup until the flesh falls off your bone.

240
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:43,000
Aye! Aye! Aye! Aye! Aye! Aye!

241
00:17:43,216 --> 00:17:44,433
Now you've done it!

242
00:17:44,505 --> 00:17:45,958
What are y'all looking at?

243
00:17:47,058 --> 00:17:49,328
Your bowl of soup, it looks yummy.

244
00:17:49,413 --> 00:17:51,815
You know, I don't think you're
as tough as you say you are.

245
00:17:51,846 --> 00:17:53,347
You act like a big baby.

246
00:17:53,817 --> 00:17:55,452
Get this straight I'm the fiercest

247
00:17:55,482 --> 00:17:57,821
most dastardly monster
on the face of the earth.

248
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:01,957
Oh?! Why you pint-size
nuisance. You think you're so tough?

249
00:18:02,113 --> 00:18:05,200
Well before he died my
grandpa did teach me karate.

250
00:18:05,231 --> 00:18:07,189
Karate? Don't make me laugh.

251
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,767
It's the power, not the
tool that gets the job done.

252
00:18:10,281 --> 00:18:12,341
If you think you got
something take out this tree.

253
00:18:14,615 --> 00:18:16,319
Ok, can't be that hard.

254
00:18:17,505 --> 00:18:19,433
Hey, give it your best shot.

255
00:18:32,723 --> 00:18:34,804
Huh, would you look at that time?

256
00:18:34,944 --> 00:18:36,464
Gotta go.

257
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,731
Yaaah!

258
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:41,259
See ya!

259
00:18:43,546 --> 00:18:46,480
- Hey, wait!
- Gokû come back!

260
00:18:46,517 --> 00:18:48,233
Where are you going?

261
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,733
Stop!

262
00:19:01,484 --> 00:19:03,600
Kids fast. Can't shake um.

263
00:19:17,172 --> 00:19:19,700
Huh? That's an odd look.

264
00:19:20,607 --> 00:19:22,633
Watch who you call odd tail boy.

265
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:24,770
This is my real face.

266
00:19:28,482 --> 00:19:31,107
Ah! Look where we are.

267
00:19:31,138 --> 00:19:32,727
This is where he is!

268
00:19:32,758 --> 00:19:34,260
You know, him!

269
00:19:37,682 --> 00:19:38,884
Who's, him?

270
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,967
It's Yamcha!

271
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:05,619
Ahh, he looks mad!

272
00:20:06,075 --> 00:20:08,545
Say hello to the great bandit Yamcha!

273
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,079
And I'm his trusty sidekick.

274
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,335
Puar, that's enough.

275
00:20:11,365 --> 00:20:13,767
You two have landed on
the wrong side of my wall.

276
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:15,696
Prepare to suffer the consequences.

277
00:20:15,867 --> 00:20:16,733
Who's he again?

278
00:20:16,764 --> 00:20:19,568
Haven't you been paying
attention? He's a ruthless cutthroat.

279
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:23,130
He's gonna take everything we
own and make pork chops out of us.

280
00:20:23,397 --> 00:20:25,633
Pork chops? I'm real hungry.

281
00:20:25,664 --> 00:20:28,100
Take my advice young man,
don't hang around that twit.

282
00:20:28,131 --> 00:20:30,131
We attended Shapeshifting Academy together.

283
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:32,367
Till he got caught stealing panties.

284
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:33,960
Isn't that right Oolong.

285
00:20:35,076 --> 00:20:36,064
Enough!

286
00:20:37,432 --> 00:20:40,042
Kid, can you drop Yamcha?

287
00:20:40,545 --> 00:20:41,905
Uh, guess so.

288
00:20:41,987 --> 00:20:45,173
Confidence kid. And see
what you can do. Piece of cake.

289
00:20:46,957 --> 00:20:49,033
You want me you gotta go through him.

290
00:20:49,163 --> 00:20:50,258
Yeah?

291
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:53,996
Well this sword, will go through
both of you at the same time.

292
00:20:54,216 --> 00:20:56,059
Um, ah, he's all your's kid.

293
00:20:56,579 --> 00:20:58,333
How come you're such
a coward all of a sudden?

294
00:20:58,364 --> 00:20:59,681
What do you mean all of a sudden?

295
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:00,999
I take offense to that.

296
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,988
I've been a coward my whole life!

297
00:21:04,027 --> 00:21:07,650
Well, I'm not a coward lamb chop. Fight me!

298
00:21:08,817 --> 00:21:11,147
The names Yamcha you idiot!

299
00:21:11,817 --> 00:21:13,837
- Hold this.
- Right!

300
00:21:37,435 --> 00:21:39,310
Power pole.

301
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,103
Extend!

302
00:21:42,777 --> 00:21:44,011
Oof!

303
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:54,091
Yamcha use your special move.

304
00:21:55,437 --> 00:21:57,506
Alright kid.

305
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:02,103
Get ready.

306
00:22:04,651 --> 00:22:06,316
Wolf Fang Fist!

307
00:22:06,605 --> 00:22:07,833
I'm hungry...

308
00:22:28,653 --> 00:22:31,115
We gotta fight before
I can eat! Fine by me!

309
00:22:31,146 --> 00:22:32,693
Ahhh!

310
00:22:32,986 --> 00:22:33,779
Yeaaah!

311
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,039
Rock!

312
00:22:35,349 --> 00:22:36,667
Scissors!

313
00:22:39,344 --> 00:22:40,533
Paper!

314
00:22:45,491 --> 00:22:47,742
Can we stop now I'm starving

315
00:22:48,009 --> 00:22:49,993
I'll kill you!

316
00:22:56,134 --> 00:22:57,259
Huh?

317
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:23,033
Yamaha, why did you do that?

318
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:25,548
Have a little problem around women ok.

319
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:27,588
What happened to your tooth it's missing.

320
00:23:27,619 --> 00:23:28,328
What?!

321
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:30,889
I'm serious, here, I'll show you.

322
00:23:35,406 --> 00:23:38,200
I'll never get a date now!

323
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,933
You'll pay for this!

324
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,967
Hey! Was that guy a friend of yours?

325
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:48,733
He had sort of a boyish charm.

326
00:23:48,764 --> 00:23:51,564
You didn't by any chance
happen to get his number, did you?

327
00:24:00,183 --> 00:24:04,222
Oolong, if you're going to stay with
us you have to follow a few rules.

328
00:24:04,253 --> 00:24:07,461
Like no 30-foot monsters
in the house, understand?

329
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,600
Sure whatever. Pick on the pig.

330
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:13,000
And what were you doing wandering
around so late at night Pansy?

331
00:24:13,063 --> 00:24:14,233
I'm sorry.

332
00:24:14,264 --> 00:24:16,759
I know it was dangerous
but I didn't have a choice.

333
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:20,362
See I'm heading south to find the
island where great Master Roshi lives.

334
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:22,614
Master Roshi?

335
00:24:22,645 --> 00:24:24,264
Oh, I've heard of him.

336
00:24:24,818 --> 00:24:26,341
They call him the turtle hermit.

337
00:24:26,372 --> 00:24:28,400
He's one of those old
wise zen master types.

338
00:24:28,431 --> 00:24:30,385
Lives all alone in a dinky hut.

339
00:24:30,449 --> 00:24:32,767
Supposed to be a big martial art expert.

340
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:33,716
Wow!

341
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:36,034
He sounds like someone I like to know.

342
00:24:36,065 --> 00:24:39,400
Well come to think of it we happen
to be going south ourselves Pansy.

343
00:24:39,431 --> 00:24:40,767
Please, take me along.

344
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:43,072
I'll teach Gokû some table manners.

345
00:24:43,103 --> 00:24:45,367
Why do you want to meet
this turtle hermit anyway?

346
00:24:45,398 --> 00:24:47,184
Because he's powerful.

347
00:24:47,446 --> 00:24:50,854
He can save my home from being
destroyed. Maybe the whole world.

348
00:24:50,885 --> 00:24:52,114
The whole world.

349
00:24:52,442 --> 00:24:53,505
Alright maybe not.

350
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:55,032
But at least he could save my neighborhood

351
00:24:55,062 --> 00:24:57,483
from the mean people
digging up our Blood Rubies.

352
00:24:57,514 --> 00:24:59,101
Did you say Blood Rubies?

353
00:24:59,132 --> 00:24:59,858
Uh-huh.

354
00:25:00,301 --> 00:25:01,969
What are Blood Rubies?

355
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,999
The most valuable
gemstones known to mankind.

356
00:25:05,092 --> 00:25:06,662
What are gemstones?

357
00:25:06,693 --> 00:25:07,930
You are so dense.

358
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,000
Gemstones are shiny pretty
rocks like the Dragon Balls.

359
00:25:12,162 --> 00:25:14,067
Oh forget it! I'll tell you later.

360
00:25:14,098 --> 00:25:16,033
What, I didn't say anything.

361
00:25:18,722 --> 00:25:19,972
Sorry.

362
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,441
Please continue.

363
00:25:22,057 --> 00:25:26,068
You see, it all began when someone
found out about the Blood Rubies.

364
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:29,207
There beautiful but they
are haunted by an evil curse.

365
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:30,670
Our king used to be kind,

366
00:25:30,701 --> 00:25:34,391
but ever since he started mining the
rubies he's turned into a mean old creep.

367
00:25:34,422 --> 00:25:36,210
Everyone in my town's afraid of him.

368
00:25:36,241 --> 00:25:38,028
Even my parents. But I'm not.

369
00:25:38,059 --> 00:25:40,170
And I'm going to stop
him no matter what it takes.

370
00:25:40,201 --> 00:25:41,974
The ruby's change your king?

371
00:25:42,005 --> 00:25:44,394
He's cruel and greedy.

372
00:25:44,425 --> 00:25:46,433
His army's torn up our land.

373
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,247
He doesn't care.

374
00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:50,217
He's destroying our people.

375
00:25:51,642 --> 00:25:54,067
King Gurumes has made life miserable.

376
00:25:54,294 --> 00:25:56,333
Ahhh!

377
00:25:59,305 --> 00:26:01,196
But there's nothing we can do.

378
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:04,118
What are a few farmers
against the army of the king.

379
00:26:04,328 --> 00:26:05,418
They do as they please

380
00:26:05,448 --> 00:26:09,298
and then force us to watch as
the flowers in our forest slowly die.

381
00:26:09,329 --> 00:26:10,415
And what's worse,

382
00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:13,279
the king's been searching
for the seven Dragon Balls.

383
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,967
He's already got five.

384
00:26:15,114 --> 00:26:18,494
When he gets all seven he's
gonna make a terrible wish.

385
00:26:18,631 --> 00:26:20,537
King Gurumes is after them?

386
00:26:20,597 --> 00:26:23,434
Then he must be the one who
took my grandpa's Dragon Ball

387
00:26:23,465 --> 00:26:25,867
I thought the thieves we tangled
with were working on their own.

388
00:26:25,898 --> 00:26:27,767
I didn't know the king
himself would actually...

389
00:26:27,798 --> 00:26:31,311
He would! And now we have to
find Master Roshi before it's too late.

390
00:26:31,342 --> 00:26:33,700
Only he can help me out of this mess.

391
00:26:34,151 --> 00:26:35,565
Did you hear that Puar?

392
00:26:35,596 --> 00:26:37,279
- Every single word.
- Come on.

393
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:39,233
It's time the two of us took a little trip.

394
00:26:43,503 --> 00:26:46,588
So tell me, what is the plan
you have in mind master?

395
00:26:46,657 --> 00:26:49,196
If I can get to Master Roshi first.

396
00:26:49,819 --> 00:26:52,385
I can fix it so he takes
care of that little brat

397
00:26:52,415 --> 00:26:54,945
and his friends while I
go after the Dragon Balls.

398
00:26:55,161 --> 00:26:56,752
And if what they say is true

399
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,885
I'll get what I've always wished for.

400
00:26:58,915 --> 00:27:01,117
And what exactly would that be, my master

401
00:27:01,148 --> 00:27:02,862
I thought that would be obvious.

402
00:27:02,893 --> 00:27:07,049
My fondest wish is to be cured of my
shyness around women once and for all.

403
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,803
I'm a little disappointed,

404
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:14,318
don't you want fabulous
riches or to rule the world?

405
00:27:14,348 --> 00:27:15,379
Something like that?

406
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:16,239
No way.

407
00:27:16,269 --> 00:27:17,967
I'm not interested in being king.

408
00:27:17,998 --> 00:27:20,660
When it comes to riches I
can steal all the money I want.

409
00:27:20,709 --> 00:27:21,921
As for women...

410
00:27:22,585 --> 00:27:23,288
Ahem.

411
00:27:23,744 --> 00:27:27,833
I want to fall in love and get married
and at least go out on a few dates.

412
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,323
Uh. Master, are you
sure you're feeling alright?

413
00:27:31,635 --> 00:27:35,033
- Never felt better. Let's go.
- Yamcha!

414
00:27:53,404 --> 00:27:55,246
Only 2 more to be found.

415
00:27:55,417 --> 00:27:59,200
Then the Eternal Dragon will
free me from this abysmal hunger.

416
00:27:59,231 --> 00:28:03,106
And my belly will know the
sublime sensation of being full.

417
00:28:07,565 --> 00:28:09,905
There it is! We made it!

418
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:19,433
Wow, that was a big wide river.

419
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:22,478
You sap, that's not a river it's an ocean.

420
00:28:22,994 --> 00:28:26,058
Hello there sir. Are you Master Roshi?

421
00:28:26,089 --> 00:28:27,256
Yes.

422
00:28:27,751 --> 00:28:29,700
Hey, get a load of this nut.

423
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,100
So you're here to kill
me and steal my shell.

424
00:28:42,131 --> 00:28:43,841
Is that it? Speak up.

425
00:28:45,068 --> 00:28:48,300
Well, I know all about
your plot. I was warned.

426
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,026
And I'm not as feeble
an opponent as I seem.

427
00:28:51,057 --> 00:28:54,600
No please wait. We haven't come
to your island to hurt you, I swear.

428
00:28:54,631 --> 00:28:57,249
Where here to ask you
for help to fire evil king.

429
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,733
- Honest.
- What?

430
00:29:00,075 --> 00:29:01,433
Did you hear that?

431
00:29:04,792 --> 00:29:06,619
Don't let them fool you old man!

432
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,622
They'd say anything to get your shell pier.

433
00:29:09,653 --> 00:29:11,549
Hey, your that goof from yesterday.

434
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,400
He's the worst one of them all.

435
00:29:15,056 --> 00:29:17,067
Why he'd steal the
shell right off your back.

436
00:29:24,018 --> 00:29:25,275
I think he shy.

437
00:29:25,306 --> 00:29:26,600
I've had enough nonsense.

438
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:29,498
It'll be easy enough to
reveal who's story is true.

439
00:29:29,881 --> 00:29:32,111
Come to me flying nimbus.

440
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:38,233
I don't see anything.

441
00:29:38,549 --> 00:29:40,467
It must be over here.

442
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:44,885
- Is that thing a cloud?
- Sharp as a tack.

443
00:29:44,915 --> 00:29:48,033
A person could fly through the
sky as they please with this baby.

444
00:29:48,205 --> 00:29:51,067
Aww! You mean someone
can really ride on that cloud?

445
00:29:51,098 --> 00:29:52,900
Oh no. Not just anyone.

446
00:29:52,987 --> 00:29:57,474
Only those who are truthful and pure
at heart can fly upon this magic cloud.

447
00:29:57,708 --> 00:30:00,653
It will not support those who are
dishonest or wicked in thought.

448
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:02,800
Here! Allow me to demonstrate!

449
00:30:14,922 --> 00:30:16,628
Yep, not just anyone.

450
00:30:16,659 --> 00:30:17,995
{\an8}That's odd,

451
00:30:18,098 --> 00:30:19,267
let me try.

452
00:30:25,704 --> 00:30:26,931
Wow!

453
00:30:26,962 --> 00:30:28,554
It likes me! It likes me!

454
00:30:30,064 --> 00:30:31,864
Whoop!

455
00:30:32,298 --> 00:30:34,181
Yeah!

456
00:30:35,714 --> 00:30:38,367
Mmm, he handles the cloud quite well!

457
00:30:38,534 --> 00:30:41,233
The truth is revealed. Our liar flees.

458
00:30:46,898 --> 00:30:48,941
Hehe, just look at him go.

459
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,980
Did he really think he could fool me?

460
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,229
Aww?!

461
00:30:54,168 --> 00:30:56,141
Mmm, this old thing?

462
00:30:56,172 --> 00:30:58,733
It washed up from the sea
one day. Why, do you like it?

463
00:31:01,084 --> 00:31:02,052
Like it!

464
00:31:02,082 --> 00:31:04,435
I love it! It's
absolutely fabulous.

465
00:31:04,466 --> 00:31:07,445
Um, well it's yours if you want it.

466
00:31:07,476 --> 00:31:10,388
- You mean it?!
- I have no use for material things...

467
00:31:10,419 --> 00:31:12,667
- You don't?
- And all I want in return...

468
00:31:12,876 --> 00:31:15,782
Is a peek at your supple boobies.

469
00:31:15,914 --> 00:31:16,781
Mmm!

470
00:31:17,143 --> 00:31:20,705
Disgraceful! You should be ashamed
of yourself you dirty old man.

471
00:31:20,736 --> 00:31:22,433
Stop trying to ruin my play.

472
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:24,700
What would you know
about boobies plankton sniffer.

473
00:31:24,731 --> 00:31:27,900
Here we go, whatever you
do kid don't pull his finger.

474
00:31:28,601 --> 00:31:31,933
Fine. I'll do it. But you
have to give me the orb first.

475
00:31:31,964 --> 00:31:35,595
- What?! Are you nuts!
- Shhh!

476
00:31:36,085 --> 00:31:39,193
Allow me to be the voice of all
that is decent and sane by saying.

477
00:31:39,224 --> 00:31:40,795
What the hell!

478
00:31:40,826 --> 00:31:42,733
No way. No how. Not happening.

479
00:31:43,673 --> 00:31:45,867
If you do this I'll give you my panties.

480
00:31:46,444 --> 00:31:47,867
Deal!

481
00:31:48,403 --> 00:31:49,800
What in the hell is that?

482
00:31:49,831 --> 00:31:51,416
This is what I look like!

483
00:31:51,447 --> 00:31:53,033
Everyone's a critic.

484
00:31:53,382 --> 00:31:55,600
Transformation!

485
00:32:00,183 --> 00:32:01,712
Is this better?

486
00:32:02,802 --> 00:32:04,037
Unbelievable!

487
00:32:04,068 --> 00:32:05,642
The resemblance is uncanny.

488
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,957
You really know your stuff. I'm gorgeous.

489
00:32:07,988 --> 00:32:09,567
Don't flatter yourself.

490
00:32:14,627 --> 00:32:15,696
Perky!

491
00:32:15,822 --> 00:32:19,533
Ahh?! Stop having fun with my boobs.

492
00:32:19,564 --> 00:32:21,169
I. I can't wait!

493
00:32:21,664 --> 00:32:23,524
- Hi.
- Oh goodie.

494
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:30,507
Hey baby.

495
00:32:31,052 --> 00:32:33,133
You're a naughty girl now let me see um!

496
00:32:33,164 --> 00:32:35,900
Are you sure that's all
you wanna do big Papi?

497
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:40,031
Well now, wouldn't you
rather get more hands-on.

498
00:32:40,694 --> 00:32:40,695
Han-hands on.?!
MightyMike77020

499
00:32:40,726 --> 00:32:41,972
Han-hands on.?!

500
00:32:42,008 --> 00:32:43,152
Don't be shy.

501
00:32:43,182 --> 00:32:46,367
Come over here and I'll show
you a little game I like to call...

502
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:47,668
Bouncy bouncy.

503
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:49,058
Bouncy bouncy.

504
00:32:49,089 --> 00:32:51,767
Bouncy bouncy. Bouncy bouncy.

505
00:32:52,385 --> 00:32:53,185
Bouncy!

506
00:32:53,186 --> 00:32:55,267
I think that pigs enjoying this too much.

507
00:32:55,312 --> 00:32:57,000
Ready for the goods?

508
00:32:57,693 --> 00:32:59,427
Peekaboo.

509
00:33:09,651 --> 00:33:11,652
Finally, the last 2 Dragon Balls.

510
00:33:11,682 --> 00:33:13,567
Launch to pickpocket missiles.

511
00:33:16,175 --> 00:33:18,400
I can now die a happy man.

512
00:33:32,481 --> 00:33:33,813
Stop!

513
00:33:36,938 --> 00:33:38,967
Just one! It's the three-star!

514
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:41,052
Lousy first-gen pickpockets.

515
00:33:41,082 --> 00:33:42,685
I told them we
needed 3 point O's.

516
00:33:42,715 --> 00:33:44,127
Will have to surface.

517
00:33:44,158 --> 00:33:45,718
Nuke um.

518
00:34:06,053 --> 00:34:07,733
Hey look, it's the king's Navy!

519
00:34:07,764 --> 00:34:09,433
I just replaced the roof!

520
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:10,835
That does it!

521
00:34:10,983 --> 00:34:13,327
This means war!

522
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:15,367
You don't have a chance
against a submarine!

523
00:34:24,415 --> 00:34:26,000
Ka...

524
00:34:26,317 --> 00:34:28,200
Me...

525
00:34:34,898 --> 00:34:36,886
Ha...

526
00:34:41,575 --> 00:34:44,533
Me...

527
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,780
Fire!

528
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:59,500
Ha!

529
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:30,600
That was great Master Roshi!
Can you teach me how to do it?

530
00:35:32,944 --> 00:35:33,985
Forget it kiddo!

531
00:35:34,015 --> 00:35:37,578
Mastering the Kamehameha
wave takes 50 years of training!

532
00:35:37,609 --> 00:35:39,018
Fifty years?!

533
00:35:39,049 --> 00:35:43,067
He knew you could help me. Your Kamehameha
thingy could stop all the bad guys.

534
00:35:43,325 --> 00:35:44,177
Eh?

535
00:35:44,832 --> 00:35:47,655
King Gurumes is destroying
my home. Help us.

536
00:35:47,686 --> 00:35:48,786
You're our only hope.

537
00:35:48,817 --> 00:35:49,928
Will do whatever you ask.

538
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:54,586
Ka... me... ha... me...

539
00:35:54,897 --> 00:35:57,167
Ha!

540
00:36:00,788 --> 00:36:04,547
I did it! I did it! This
Kamehameha stuff really works!

541
00:36:05,674 --> 00:36:08,804
- I mean, 50 years give or take.
- Yay!

542
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,913
I'm hungry. Don't they
serve peanuts on this flight?

543
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:32,424
I'm honored that you want my help child.

544
00:36:32,455 --> 00:36:35,033
But I'm too old to go on some wild crusade.

545
00:36:35,409 --> 00:36:37,600
But you already travel with a champion.

546
00:36:37,691 --> 00:36:39,831
Gokû is powerful beyond measure.

547
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:43,539
I've never seen anyone learn
the Kamehameha wave so fast.

548
00:36:44,453 --> 00:36:47,633
The power of light dwells
strongly within him Pansy.

549
00:36:50,318 --> 00:36:54,267
{\an8}In your friends you will find enough
help to save your troubled land.

550
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:55,557
{\an8}Even still...

551
00:36:55,595 --> 00:36:57,674
{\an8}Your greatest ally is yourself.

552
00:36:57,743 --> 00:37:01,568
{\an8}All you need to triumph is
inside of you, not someone else.

553
00:37:01,734 --> 00:37:04,033
He can philosophy till his head explodes,

554
00:37:04,064 --> 00:37:06,869
but I say he's too darn
lazy to make the trip.

555
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,794
Cheer up Pansy, we're a team.

556
00:37:08,832 --> 00:37:10,302
And will stop that mean old king.

557
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:12,014
Everything will work out just fine.

558
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,306
Don't buy into that kid,

559
00:37:13,337 --> 00:37:16,064
we're a team until she gets the first
chance to make a wish of our own.

560
00:37:18,104 --> 00:37:20,276
Come to think of it, you
haven't said word one about it.

561
00:37:20,306 --> 00:37:22,200
What's your wish, oh selfish one?

562
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:25,800
Oh I didn't tell you? It's so
obvious, a handsome boyfriend.

563
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,148
I can't believe I'm hanging
out with someone so lame.

564
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:31,472
This from someone's whose greatest
aspiration is to collect girls' panties.

565
00:37:31,503 --> 00:37:35,193
Only those made from Egyptian
cotton. I have my standards.

566
00:37:38,029 --> 00:37:40,400
Pasta, tell me something good.

567
00:37:40,752 --> 00:37:44,391
Yes sire, wonderful news. The
final Dragon Ball is on its way here.

568
00:37:44,556 --> 00:37:48,300
At last I will be relieved
of this unbearable pain.

569
00:37:49,009 --> 00:37:50,600
It won't be long.

570
00:38:01,429 --> 00:38:02,900
The palace!

571
00:38:06,781 --> 00:38:08,867
Destroy that aircraft immediately!

572
00:38:08,898 --> 00:38:11,467
You can recover the last
Dragon Ball from the wreckage.

573
00:38:27,425 --> 00:38:29,295
Maybe they just want to say hi.

574
00:39:05,174 --> 00:39:08,049
Ahhh!

575
00:39:33,353 --> 00:39:36,867
The pain... what's taking so long?

576
00:39:37,089 --> 00:39:39,378
I need the last Dragon Ball.

577
00:39:39,409 --> 00:39:40,631
Now!

578
00:39:58,486 --> 00:39:59,733
Here I come!

579
00:40:10,586 --> 00:40:11,563
Ahh!

580
00:40:43,564 --> 00:40:44,900
I can't believe it!

581
00:40:45,134 --> 00:40:46,774
look at all these Blood Rubies.

582
00:40:46,805 --> 00:40:48,825
Grab a bunch and let's go!

583
00:40:51,309 --> 00:40:54,067
Hey, where you going? Wait for me will ya!

584
00:40:57,071 --> 00:40:58,962
Ahhh!

585
00:41:02,258 --> 00:41:04,288
Awesome job, Oolong!

586
00:41:06,626 --> 00:41:08,733
More soldiers Oolong. You know what to do.

587
00:41:08,764 --> 00:41:09,803
No problem.

588
00:41:19,434 --> 00:41:20,933
Aw Puar!

589
00:41:21,084 --> 00:41:22,508
Oolong...

590
00:41:23,295 --> 00:41:24,694
Hey, you came back!

591
00:41:24,936 --> 00:41:26,666
H-H-How are you doing?

592
00:41:37,727 --> 00:41:39,433
They killed Yamcha!

593
00:41:39,756 --> 00:41:42,397
End of the line. Give me the Dragon Ball.

594
00:41:42,428 --> 00:41:44,033
Over your dead body!

595
00:41:44,064 --> 00:41:46,684
You got guts. Too bad I gotta spill them.

596
00:41:46,741 --> 00:41:48,156
Ugh!

597
00:41:54,715 --> 00:41:56,150
Oh? Hum?

598
00:42:06,579 --> 00:42:08,644
Yamcha get up and fight!

599
00:42:28,084 --> 00:42:29,400
You saved my life...

600
00:42:29,431 --> 00:42:30,699
Are you ok?

601
00:42:46,074 --> 00:42:48,000
Ok power pole!

602
00:42:48,258 --> 00:42:49,719
Extend!

603
00:42:49,802 --> 00:42:50,927
Ah!

604
00:42:52,725 --> 00:42:55,133
I didn't sign up for a hernia.

605
00:43:01,578 --> 00:43:02,586
Uh-oh!

606
00:43:03,258 --> 00:43:04,367
The pain...

607
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:06,667
King Gurumes!

608
00:43:06,842 --> 00:43:08,933
Unyielding hunger.

609
00:43:08,934 --> 00:43:10,367
Bulma!

610
00:43:11,451 --> 00:43:12,700
I'm fine.

611
00:43:13,312 --> 00:43:15,880
The last Dragon Ball, I need it!

612
00:43:15,911 --> 00:43:17,109
Give it to me!

613
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:18,509
Now!

614
00:43:45,954 --> 00:43:47,400
You make a nice doormat.

615
00:43:48,011 --> 00:43:49,730
Ahhh!

616
00:43:52,404 --> 00:43:54,103
I bit my tongue.

617
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:08,574
Ka...

618
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:09,693
Me...

619
00:44:09,694 --> 00:44:11,118
Ha...

620
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:12,867
Me...

621
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,375
It's glowing?!

622
00:44:18,477 --> 00:44:20,707
Ha!

623
00:44:23,821 --> 00:44:25,871
Huh? What's going on?

624
00:44:25,902 --> 00:44:27,780
Shouldn't you have exploded or something?

625
00:44:29,863 --> 00:44:31,106
So that's it.

626
00:44:31,137 --> 00:44:34,069
The other Dragon Balls are
inside the king's big fat stomach.

627
00:44:36,165 --> 00:44:38,035
Here, chew on this!

628
00:44:38,321 --> 00:44:39,149
Now!

629
00:44:39,536 --> 00:44:41,906
Come forth, Eternal Dragon!

630
00:45:20,528 --> 00:45:22,388
- Look at the size of that thing.
- Ooh it's the dragon.

631
00:45:25,709 --> 00:45:28,006
Grr!

632
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:35,643
Who has united the 7 balls
and disturb my slumber.

633
00:45:35,674 --> 00:45:39,967
Speak your wish so I may
Grant it and return to my lair.

634
00:46:00,106 --> 00:46:04,567
Why are you silent? Do
not waste my time. Speak!

635
00:46:04,715 --> 00:46:08,246
Roarrrrrr.

636
00:46:08,847 --> 00:46:11,535
- I-I wish for the...!
- For my wish Shenron..!

637
00:46:11,566 --> 00:46:13,233
Let me say one, please!

638
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:18,200
I wish my land was
beautiful and peaceful again

639
00:46:18,231 --> 00:46:19,218
huh?

640
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:23,714
So be it.

641
00:46:31,125 --> 00:46:34,285
No! Not my precious Blood Rubies!

642
00:46:45,238 --> 00:46:48,467
Your wish has been granted!

643
00:46:48,707 --> 00:46:51,167
Fare-thee-well.

644
00:46:58,615 --> 00:47:01,094
Thank you, Shenron.

645
00:47:05,532 --> 00:47:09,278
Aww, and just when I was
about to wish for a cute boyfriend.

646
00:47:09,374 --> 00:47:11,767
All I wanted was a girlfriend!

647
00:47:11,956 --> 00:47:13,612
Huh? Uh...

648
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:18,169
Now I'll have to start searching for
grandpa's Dragon Ball all over again.

649
00:47:19,509 --> 00:47:21,431
I'm back to my old self.

650
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:24,467
But I'm still so hungry.

651
00:47:29,068 --> 00:47:30,400
Delicious!

652
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:32,867
What do you call this sweet juicy orb?

653
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:33,993
An apple.

654
00:47:34,024 --> 00:47:36,632
An apple? Incredible.

655
00:47:36,819 --> 00:47:38,023
I agree.

656
00:47:38,864 --> 00:47:42,499
One of the many treasures you nearly
destroyed while searching for Blood Rubies.

657
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:43,667
Daddy!

658
00:47:43,704 --> 00:47:45,254
I didn't know.

659
00:47:46,169 --> 00:47:47,802
I'm so ashamed.

660
00:47:53,097 --> 00:47:55,533
- I missed you!
- My girl.

661
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:00,700
Here, I forgot to give you back your coin.

662
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:09,007
Flying Nimbus. Come here.

663
00:48:13,453 --> 00:48:15,133
I hate happy endings.

664
00:48:15,164 --> 00:48:16,857
We'll live happily ever after!

665
00:48:17,202 --> 00:48:21,200
Flying Nimbus away!

666
00:48:25,933 --> 00:48:27,900
Bye Gokû!

667
00:48:28,337 --> 00:48:32,709
