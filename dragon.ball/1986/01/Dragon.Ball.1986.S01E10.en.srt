1
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:03,875
 Our heroes, Goku and
Bulma, along with Oolong the 

2
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:06,875
shape-changing pig, are
unaware that they're still being

3
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,584
tailed by Yamcha and Puar as
they follow their radar to

4
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:13,250
the seventh, and
final, Dragon Ball!

5
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,917
 It won't be
long now, you guys!

6
00:02:18,917 --> 00:02:20,334
 Wow!

7
00:02:20,417 --> 00:02:23,084
I can't believe I'm so close
to having my wish fulfilled!

8
00:02:23,167 --> 00:02:25,500
I wonder what he's
going to look like?

9
00:02:25,584 --> 00:02:27,375
 Hey, I've
been meaning to ask.

10
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:29,375
So this big wish--
there's gonna be enough

11
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:30,959
for all of us, right?

12
00:02:31,042 --> 00:02:32,959
I was thinking along the lines
of all the gold in the world!

13
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,792
 Oh, I forgot
to tell you didn't I?

14
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:39,292
A boyfriend! That's
what I'll wish for!

15
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:42,084
 What?! A boyfriend?!

16
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:43,667
 What's wrong?

17
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,417
 So you're gonna waste
our wish so you can get yourself

18
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,125
a boyfriend? What a rip off!

19
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,209
 What?!
You take that back!

20
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:52,959
I think that
you're just jealous!

21
00:02:54,292 --> 00:02:55,959
 I knew I
should have stayed at home!

22
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:57,667
 Whoa! Slow down!

23
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,917
 Look out!

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,917
 Huh?

25
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:04,750
--
--

26
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:09,334
 Learn how to drive!

27
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:33,250
 Hey Yamcha , I'm
beginning to think they're lost.

28
00:03:33,334 --> 00:03:36,292
I can't believe the last
Dragon Ball is way out here!

29
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,459
 Be patient.
Puar, It's out there,

30
00:03:38,542 --> 00:03:41,084
I know it is! I can
feel it--we're close!

31
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:42,167
Real close!

32
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,417
Soon I will wish
away my fear of women!

33
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:50,209
--
--

34
00:03:50,292 --> 00:03:52,500
 I'm gonna be toast if
I don't get to that meeting

35
00:03:52,584 --> 00:03:54,042
with Emperor PIlaf!

36
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,375
 Mai, if you don't fix
that Dragon Ball detector by

37
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:59,375
the time I count to ten, then
you will be joining my hungry

38
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,084
friends here for lunch!

39
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:05,417
One...

40
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,125
Two...

41
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:10,084
Three...

42
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,042
Four...

43
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:11,917
Five...

44
00:04:13,292 --> 00:04:14,959
 Uh, Emperor Pilaf!
Speaking of lunch, you...

45
00:04:15,042 --> 00:04:16,209
you must be hungry right?

46
00:04:17,084 --> 00:04:19,500
 Well, yes. I am hungry!

47
00:04:19,584 --> 00:04:23,125
Starving, really. You
know, a hamburger

48
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:24,834
would be nice right now.

49
00:04:24,917 --> 00:04:27,709
Hold it! What
number was I on, Mai?

50
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:29,167
 Huh?

51
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,334
 Nevermind.
I'll start over.

52
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:33,209
One, two, three

53
00:04:33,292 --> 00:04:34,459
Four. Five. Six.

54
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,167
 Emperor Pilaf!

55
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,750
 What now?

56
00:04:38,834 --> 00:04:40,375
 Oh nothing, it's just...
well, sometimes, when you take

57
00:04:40,459 --> 00:04:43,875
command like this, it's
invigorating to be around you.

58
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:46,667
 Oh! I see!

59
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:51,792
Oh, right. Now
where was I?

60
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:52,667
 Huh?

61
00:04:54,292 --> 00:04:56,084
 Okay, maybe
I should start at...

62
00:04:56,167 --> 00:04:56,667
Six!

63
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,125
 I made it sire! I made it!

64
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:04,542
 Excellent, Shu,
you're right on time.

65
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:08,042
Now, have you
located the balls? Report!

66
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,167
 Well, I ordered pizza.

67
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,542
 Sire, I fixed it!

68
00:05:13,917 --> 00:05:15,917
 The Dragon Ball detector
is working and we're already

69
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,875
receiving a signal
on one of the balls.

70
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:20,417
Attempting to isolate signal
and increase magnification

71
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,459
to level five.

72
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:23,375
 Level six, seven, eight.

73
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:25,917
Signal isolated at
magnification level nine, sir!

74
00:05:27,917 --> 00:05:30,500
Oh my! This can't be!

75
00:05:30,584 --> 00:05:33,250
There's a ball just ten
steps south of this location!

76
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:34,709
And a couple
of steps east.

77
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,584
No, wait... it's south.

78
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:39,667
By about... oh...
I'd say seven paces.

79
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:42,834
Then, six steps straight
ahead and you're there!

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,709
 I found it!

81
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:46,917
 Argh!

82
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:51,167
Oh, what do we have here?

83
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,709
Look, it's a Dragon Ball!
The one we already have!

84
00:05:55,792 --> 00:05:58,875
That monkey-boy and his friends
have the Dragon Balls we want,

85
00:05:58,959 --> 00:05:59,709
so where is he?!

86
00:06:00,792 --> 00:06:03,167
We have a spy
bird tracking him.

87
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,667
 Mecha number seven.

88
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,625
There it is now, Emperor.

89
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:11,209
 Once we download the
visuals from Mecha 7, we'll know

90
00:06:11,292 --> 00:06:13,084
exactly where they are going.

91
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,834
Ringleader, they just passed
out of the northern quadrant

92
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:42,334
and they're heading southwest!

93
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:43,584
Over!

94
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:46,084
 Excellent! Tell
big brother to engage!

95
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:47,250
Roger!

96
00:06:47,334 --> 00:06:48,750
 Come in, big
brother, do you copy?

97
00:06:48,834 --> 00:06:49,917
Over!

98
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,167
 10-4, baby sister!
I got my ears on!

99
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,167
The subject
is approaching.

100
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,084
 Okie-dokie! Over!

101
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,459
Bulma, I'm going to
ask you nicely this time.

102
00:07:00,542 --> 00:07:03,084
Would you please,
please change your wish!

103
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,375
There must be something
you want that the three of us

104
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:06,959
can split between us?

105
00:07:07,042 --> 00:07:09,334
Remember, Oolong, just
one word from me and you'll have

106
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:11,959
to go to the bathroom
thanks to that pill!

107
00:07:13,792 --> 00:07:15,959
--
--

108
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,625
Oolong, you're making me mad!

109
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:20,500
 This is
a protest, Bulma!

110
00:07:20,584 --> 00:07:23,125
I'm not moving another inch
until you change your wish

111
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:24,625
to something reasonable!

112
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:28,042
Sure! I wish you'd just
shut your face and drive!

113
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:33,209
Now I've got 'em!

114
00:07:33,292 --> 00:07:35,042
This could take all day, Puar.

115
00:07:36,834 --> 00:07:39,084
Look, we've come all this way!

116
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,584
Let's just shut
up and go for it!

117
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:43,750
Not this pig!

118
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:45,667
Piggy!

119
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,834
Piggy! Piggy!

120
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:49,709
That's not fair!

121
00:07:53,917 --> 00:07:56,709
 They're sitting
ducks! 

122
00:07:57,209 --> 00:07:59,959
I hope your new
boyfriend comes with diapers.

123
00:08:17,334 --> 00:08:19,125
What happened?

124
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:22,125
Ow! Uh? We got blown up!

125
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:23,084
Think we should help them?!

126
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:25,125
In a minute, Puar!

127
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,167
 Oh no!

128
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:39,625
Wow! What is that?

129
00:08:44,209 --> 00:08:47,167
 I've come to
repossess your Dragon Balls!

130
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:56,167
Thank you! And
so long, suckers!

131
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,750
 The balls are mine now!

132
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,334
That thing just
stole our Dragon Balls!

133
00:09:06,417 --> 00:09:08,459
'Reposessed' them.

134
00:09:08,542 --> 00:09:10,000
It stole them!

135
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:12,417
Goku, you're our only hope!
Hurry!

136
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,917
Call the Flying Nimbus!

137
00:09:15,042 --> 00:09:17,167
Flying Nimbus!

138
00:09:26,042 --> 00:09:27,417
 Hurry up, Nimbus!

139
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:39,000
 Get those
Dragon Balls, Goku!

140
00:09:39,084 --> 00:09:40,667
We're counting on you!

141
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,750
I think we actually did it,
Shu!

142
00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:05,959
 Emperor Pilaf
will be very happy!

143
00:10:06,042 --> 00:10:07,667
 Maybe he'll even
stop yelling at us!

144
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:24,625
 There it is!

145
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,750
Okay, monster! Don't
you know it's not nice

146
00:10:30,834 --> 00:10:32,375
to steal stuff?!

147
00:10:35,417 --> 00:10:37,125
What's wrong with him?

148
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,417
Hey, you, monster!

149
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,500
Give me back those
Dragon Balls or else!

150
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:45,792
Maybe he's playing dead.

151
00:10:48,584 --> 00:10:51,334
Hello? Come on, wake up!

152
00:10:57,709 --> 00:11:00,459
Hey! That's it! Hand 'em over!

153
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,750
Hey, you!

154
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,625
Stiff as board.
Yup, he's dead.

155
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,917
 Oh, it sure is
taking Goku a long time...

156
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,959
Hey, kid, I got an idea!
Forget that wish, okay?

157
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:45,959
What? No way!

158
00:11:46,042 --> 00:11:47,625
Hey, I could
be your boyfriend!

159
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:49,000
Whatta ya say? Huh?

160
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:51,500
I say thanks,
but no thanks! Got it?!

161
00:11:51,584 --> 00:11:53,584
Yeah I got it.
It's your loss.

162
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:54,959
Yeah, right!

163
00:11:55,042 --> 00:11:56,584
Oh, now I see
what you're after.

164
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:58,917
You don't want a
real hunk, do ya?

165
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,584
You want some conjured up
whipping boy from that dragon.

166
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,250
What do you
mean by that, huh?!

167
00:12:05,334 --> 00:12:07,000
 Hey guys!

168
00:12:07,084 --> 00:12:08,709
 Goku!

169
00:12:09,584 --> 00:12:11,167
That monster's dead!

170
00:12:12,334 --> 00:12:15,042
 Uh, Goku?
Who's got the Dragon Balls?!

171
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,542
 Uh, I don't know.

172
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,250
It's all over!

173
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,375
 My boyfriend!
It's not fair!

174
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:28,459
They've probably summoned
the Dragon already...

175
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,625
But, I've still got one.

176
00:12:38,042 --> 00:12:39,042
Of course!

177
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,167
They thought they
could outsmart us!

178
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,834
No way, mister!

179
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,875
You did it!
You're the best! Yay!

180
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,792
I knew I could count on you!

181
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:48,917
It was easy
Bulma, honest!

182
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,292
You don't have to thank me.

183
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:52,125
You can thank me!

184
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,417
Now! Let's get 'em!

185
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,792
Let's get out there and
find those Dragon Balls!

186
00:12:58,459 --> 00:12:59,917
They won't get far!

187
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,959
Get in the car, you two! We
can track them with my radar!

188
00:13:03,042 --> 00:13:06,125
 Hey, fearless
leader! You forget?

189
00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:07,792
Our car got blown up!

190
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:11,875
Ah-ah-ah! That's okay, Oolong.

191
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:13,834
I still have my Dyno Caps!

192
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:20,209
Oh, I forgot! They were
in there with the Dragon Balls!

193
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,084
 What should
we do, Yamcha?

194
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:30,375
I think they need a lift.

195
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:33,084
I know,
and she scares me...

196
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:34,292
Now what?

197
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,709
No choice.
We've gotta give them a ride.

198
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:39,500
But Yamcha, what about
your fear of girls?!

199
00:13:39,584 --> 00:13:43,167
I don't have a choice.
If we don't help them now,

200
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,375
we're never gonna get
those Dragon Balls!

201
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:52,834
Stop crying, we'll think
of something, you'll see.

202
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:55,250
You're just saying that.

203
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,334
You're right.
He is just saying that.

204
00:13:57,417 --> 00:13:59,625
Oh, would you keep quiet?!

205
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:00,750
 Hey, look who it is!

206
00:14:00,834 --> 00:14:01,250
 Hey, Yamcha!

207
00:14:01,334 --> 00:14:04,167
Hi, Yamcha!

208
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:08,209
What a coincidence!
Are you guys stuck out here?

209
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:13,625
Yeah! We were
until you showed up.

210
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:17,042
Could you give us a ride,
Yamcha? Pretty please!

211
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,542
Sure... we'd be...
we'd be happy to...

212
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,959
Yamcha, I know this might
sound a little weird, but

213
00:14:25,042 --> 00:14:26,917
there's something I'd
like you to do for me.

214
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,875
Would you mind closing
your eyes for a second?

215
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,084
Please?

216
00:14:31,292 --> 00:14:33,167
Close my eyes?

217
00:14:34,334 --> 00:14:35,750
Yeah, just for a second.
Pretty please?

218
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:37,584
Well, what for?

219
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:38,917
 You'll see.

220
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,292
Aw, come on.

221
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:47,084
 Oh no! Is
she really gonna kiss me?

222
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:48,750
I think I'm gonna die!

223
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:53,500
You too, Puar!

224
00:14:53,584 --> 00:14:55,542
 No peeking, you two!

225
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:56,959
 Hey, not too bad!

226
00:14:57,042 --> 00:14:58,834
 They're only about
twenty-five miles away!

227
00:14:58,917 --> 00:15:00,042
 Can I open my eyes now?

228
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,542
Sure, go ahead.

229
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,750
Hey, nothing happened!
Nothing happened...

230
00:15:05,834 --> 00:15:07,834
Nothing at all!

231
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:11,584
Hey, something happened,
I just can't say what.

232
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:13,959
Us girls, we have to keep
our secrets you know?

233
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:17,375
Don't. Be. Mad.

234
00:15:20,542 --> 00:15:21,709
That was weird.

235
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:42,459
At last, I have all
seven Dragon Balls!

236
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:43,084
Uh, sire?

237
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:44,375
 Uh...

238
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:47,792
 ♪ No more
Dragon Ball blues da-da! ♪

239
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,167
But, uh, Emperor...

240
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:49,875
We... uh?

241
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:52,250
Uh, we need... one more!

242
00:15:52,334 --> 00:15:56,167
 ♪ La-la-la  ♪

243
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,584
There's only six!

244
00:15:57,667 --> 00:15:59,625
You counted wrong.

245
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:03,625
 Did I just hear you say
we're missing a Dragon Ball?

246
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:05,875
 Yes, sir!
There's only six!

247
00:16:07,917 --> 00:16:09,459
 That can't be!

248
00:16:09,542 --> 00:16:14,875
 Seven, six, five...
Uh? There's three, and the

249
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:19,000
two ball and, uh, hmm, let's
see, I-I have the one-star ball.

250
00:16:19,084 --> 00:16:20,709
And- Oh no!

251
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:23,417
There's one missing!

252
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,459
 Is it there?!

253
00:16:27,542 --> 00:16:27,959
Nope!

254
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:29,542
Sorry, boss!

255
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:33,542
Fools!

256
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,792
And you call
yourselves agents!

257
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,375
We're very sorry, sir!

258
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:44,209
Uh, I think six
is pretty good, sire.

259
00:16:44,292 --> 00:16:45,917
We have to be better
than 'pretty good'

260
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,709
to win this game!

261
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:50,459
This is the world
we're talking about!

262
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:59,417
You did say you fixed
this thing, didn't you?

263
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,417
Yes, I did sire.

264
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,750
 Oh, goody!

265
00:17:02,834 --> 00:17:04,292
That means those kids with
the last Dragon Ball are

266
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:05,584
headed this way!

267
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:08,542
Isn't that sweet?

268
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:11,750
They're delivering it to
us! Let's go set the traps

269
00:17:11,834 --> 00:17:12,792
for our guests!

270
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:24,250
 Look at
the size of that place!

271
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:25,625
 It's huge!

272
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:28,209
 Not bad
for a summer home.

273
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,459
 Are you okay?

274
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,834
I'm alright.
I just need to make my wish.

275
00:17:34,917 --> 00:17:36,709
Then I'll be cured of this.

276
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:39,292
 Everything is ready, sire.

277
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:40,584
 Excellent!

278
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,459
Amateurs...

279
00:17:42,542 --> 00:17:45,334
They have no idea what
they're getting into!

280
00:17:46,542 --> 00:17:49,167
Soon, they will feel
the wrath of Pilaf.

281
00:17:49,584 --> 00:17:50,792
 Looks like no one's home.

282
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,542
 See if it's open, Goku.

283
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,750
 Um... I don't
think that's a good idea.

284
00:17:57,667 --> 00:18:01,000
 That's it! You got
it Goku! Keep pushing!

285
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:14,667
 Let's go!

286
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,834
 It's as
dark as night in there!

287
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:19,584
 Yeah!
And twice as scary!

288
00:18:28,459 --> 00:18:30,209
Do you guys
hear something?

289
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:32,167
 Shh! Quiet, Oolong!

290
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,584
 Oh no, bats!

291
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:51,875
What'd you do that for?!

292
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,625
Uh, I thought
you were a bat!

293
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,834
 My piggy
senses are tingling!

294
00:18:59,917 --> 00:19:01,750
We're in definite danger here!

295
00:19:01,834 --> 00:19:04,917
 Oolong, less
talking and more walking!

296
00:19:07,834 --> 00:19:10,125
 It looks clear
down this way, guys.

297
00:19:11,542 --> 00:19:13,375
 Goku,
don't walk so fast!

298
00:19:13,459 --> 00:19:14,417
 Shh!

299
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:27,000
Perfect!

300
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:45,542
--
--

301
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,000
Help me!

302
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,084
Got ya!

303
00:20:20,917 --> 00:20:22,667
 A... little help?

304
00:20:23,334 --> 00:20:24,834
 You guys okay?

305
00:20:28,334 --> 00:20:30,250
Alright! That does it!

306
00:20:30,334 --> 00:20:31,000
Let's go get 'em!

307
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:34,584
Oh, thank you!
You saved me!

308
00:20:41,917 --> 00:20:43,000
Take a breath!

309
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:46,500
Golly!

310
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,792
 That trap didn't work!

311
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:52,875
Who designed
that trap anyway?

312
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:54,917
Uh, it wasn't me, sire.

313
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,709
 I want the name of
the ninny who designed it!

314
00:20:57,792 --> 00:20:58,792
It was you.

315
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,459
 What's that sound?

316
00:21:03,542 --> 00:21:05,209
 It's just
my teeth chattering!

317
00:21:05,834 --> 00:21:08,375
 Be careful! There
could be traps everywhere!

318
00:21:08,459 --> 00:21:09,709
 Okay...

319
00:21:09,792 --> 00:21:11,625
 Puar, quit
pushing, would ya!

320
00:21:11,709 --> 00:21:13,417
 Then get moving, Oolong!

321
00:21:15,334 --> 00:21:16,584
 Hey, what's that?

322
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:20,167
It's a trap, isn't it?

323
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,292
I don't know.

324
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,667
It's too obvious.

325
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,042
 Hey there's
another arrow over here!

326
00:21:25,542 --> 00:21:27,792
 Let's check it out!

327
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,250
 Excuse me, but
where are we going, huh?

328
00:21:51,834 --> 00:21:53,209
 It's a dead end!

329
00:21:53,292 --> 00:21:56,334
 Oh, did you
have to say that, Goku?

330
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:00,375
 Oh no!

331
00:22:00,459 --> 00:22:02,334
 We're trapped!

332
00:22:03,667 --> 00:22:06,167
So, Emperor, what do
you want to do now?

333
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:09,250
I think maybe I'll
have some fun with them!

334
00:22:09,334 --> 00:22:13,125
Ah, yes. But first,
I'll take their Dragon Ball!

335
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,250

his way, what hope is there for
