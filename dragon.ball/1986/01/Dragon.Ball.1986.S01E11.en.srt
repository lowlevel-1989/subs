1
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:59,417
 Last time on
Dragon Ball: the Dragon Balls

2
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,792
were stolen from the hands of
our heroes by Emperor Pilaf's

3
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:07,834
bumbling henchmen, Mai and Shu.
Goku led a brave trek into

4
00:02:07,917 --> 00:02:11,584
Emperor Pilaf's palace to
retrieve the stolen balls.

5
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:15,209
Once inside, everyone followed
the writing on the ground.

6
00:02:15,292 --> 00:02:17,250
 It's a
trap. Don't you think?

7
00:02:20,042 --> 00:02:22,625
 Carefully, the team
crept through the caverns,

8
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,667
trying to avoid any
unforeseen dangers.

9
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,459
 But when the wall
came crashing down, our heroes

10
00:02:32,542 --> 00:02:36,250
found themselves trapped
in the cold corridor.

11
00:02:36,334 --> 00:02:39,334
And now they wait, wondering
what the evil Emperor Pilaf

12
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:41,375
has in store for them next!

13
00:02:56,834 --> 00:02:59,000
Nope, I don't
think it's in here.

14
00:02:59,084 --> 00:03:00,209
 Me, neither.

15
00:03:00,292 --> 00:03:02,542
C'mon, let's rip the
seats open. We've got to

16
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,542
find that Dragon Ball.

17
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,417
Well, looks like
we're stuck here.

18
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,667
 Wonderful! Now
I get to die today, too!

19
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,500
Hey, what's wrong?
Why're you so upset?

20
00:03:13,584 --> 00:03:15,250
Because we're prisoners.

21
00:03:15,334 --> 00:03:17,500
 Oh, don't
worry about that.

22
00:03:17,584 --> 00:03:20,292
If there's a way in.
there's gotta be a way out.

23
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,959
Goku, they're going
to try to kill us!

24
00:03:23,042 --> 00:03:25,334
Ha! Scary!

25
00:03:25,417 --> 00:03:27,500
 Don't you
take anything seriously?!

26
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:32,875
 Those ignorant buffoons!

27
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,542
Yes, I really do have to
hand it to myself, though.

28
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:39,875
The old "Follow the Pink
Arrow" trap gets 'em every time!

29
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,834
 Sire!

30
00:03:46,042 --> 00:03:47,375
 Speak to me.

31
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,709
Sir, we searched the
aircar that they came here in,

32
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:52,084
but the last Dragon Ball
definitely isn't in it.

33
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:53,625
 No?!

34
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:56,834
That means one of
them must be carrying it!

35
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:06,584
 You know, you can
never trust a short person.

36
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:08,334
Surely one of those
little runts is hiding

37
00:04:08,417 --> 00:04:10,334
the Dragon Ball from us!

38
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:16,084
 That will be the last
time you run down short people

39
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:18,750
in my presence, Agent Mai.

40
00:04:18,834 --> 00:04:22,167
And stop calling me 'Shirley'.
Do I make myself clear?

41
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,125
Oh, yes, sir. I don't know
what I was thinking...

42
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,709
You ready?

43
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:34,709
Let's do it!

44
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:40,209
Wolf Fang Fist!

45
00:04:40,834 --> 00:04:43,250
Haah!

46
00:04:56,667 --> 00:04:59,292
 I... I didn't
even put a dent in it!

47
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,417
The wall is too strong.

48
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,334
 Why don't we
give it another try?

49
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,417
Don't hurt yourself.

50
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:11,250
What's wrong, fools?
Can't break my triple-butted

51
00:05:11,334 --> 00:05:14,334
double-reinforced
steel-lined walls, can you?

52
00:05:14,417 --> 00:05:15,917
 Who are you?

53
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:19,334
I am the all-powerful
Emperor Pilaf!

54
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:22,834
So you're the jerk that
stole my Dragon Balls!

55
00:05:22,917 --> 00:05:25,459
Yes, this is true,
but I didn't get all of

56
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:27,500
them now, did I?

57
00:05:27,917 --> 00:05:29,209
 Yamcha, I
think I can get him if I

58
00:05:29,292 --> 00:05:30,542
dive through that window.

59
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:33,042
That's a TV set,
you dummy.

60
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,917
I know that one of you is
carrying the four-star ball.

61
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,584
Hand it over to me and things
will go much easier for you.

62
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:45,834
 Maybe in the
next millennium, pal!

63
00:05:45,917 --> 00:05:47,834
Check this: bleh!

64
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:54,750
So, that's how you want
to play it, little girl?

65
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:57,625
All right, then. Time
for the "Treatment"!

66
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:08,959
Oh, no! He's got her!

67
00:06:09,042 --> 00:06:11,209
Hey, uh, what did he
mean by the "Treatment"?

68
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:13,875
I... think I know...

69
00:06:18,417 --> 00:06:21,584
Get me out of this thing!
Right now, you freak!

70
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:24,792
 You insolent brat! I
am the great Emperor Pilaf and

71
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,292
I will be the only one
giving orders here today!

72
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,875
Tell me where the
last Dragon Ball is!

73
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:31,334
Now!

74
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:35,125
My magic finger says it's
somewhere in the ceiling!

75
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:38,417
I see, you actually
want the "Treatment", don't you?

76
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,709
Oh, you'll wish I
would have killed you.

77
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:49,792
 He better
not lay a hand on her!

78
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,417
 Serves her right.

79
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:02,917
Not the "Treatment"!
Have a heart!

80
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:04,500
No, please, Emperor!

81
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:30,292
There! Now, you'll tell me
exactly what I want to hear!

82
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:33,125
That's it? A kiss?

83
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:36,125
Uh, yes. Pretty scary,
don't you think?

84
00:07:42,584 --> 00:07:45,042
Is that the
best you can do?

85
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:50,084
Boy, she's pushing it!
She'd better clam up or he may

86
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:53,750
think of something
really horrible to do to her!

87
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:55,542
Man, I thought you
guys were tough!

88
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:56,750
That was easy!

89
00:07:56,834 --> 00:07:58,042
A first-grader could
think of better torture

90
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,750
than the "Treatment"!

91
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,542
What?! Did you hear
what she just said?!

92
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,000
 Yes, Emperor!

93
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,875
 I'll have you know
I got my degree in torture!

94
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:10,459
I am a certified
master of torture!

95
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:11,459
Ooh, that does it!

96
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:17,667
 You okay?

97
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,542
 Nice catch, you guys.

98
00:08:22,417 --> 00:08:23,834
 This'll take time.

99
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:25,750
Time to devise
the ultimate torture.

100
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:27,834
 I say we go
right for the Dragon Ball!

101
00:08:27,917 --> 00:08:29,750
 Quiet,
Shu! I'm devising!

102
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:33,084
But, sire. We could gas them
and then conduct a search.

103
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:38,167
Gas! Yes, great idea!
Let's give them some Yellow #3.

104
00:08:48,917 --> 00:08:50,000
 Sleeping gas!

105
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:02,709
 They're trying
to knock us all out...

106
00:09:04,042 --> 00:09:07,125
 Goku... I can't
stay awake much longer...

107
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:29,750
 Emperor Pilaf will
always prevail, kiddies!

108
00:09:30,084 --> 00:09:33,625
Yes, you think you
can outsmart me?

109
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:38,625
Well, I'll tell
you, ah... I... uh...

110
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:44,167
I tell you... quite the...

111
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,542
 Oh, Emperor!

112
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:50,417
 How fitting. A
victim of his own vapors.

113
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,834
Shu, you take the
Emperor back to his chambers.

114
00:09:52,917 --> 00:09:54,209
I'll look for the ball.

115
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:55,209
 Alrighty.

116
00:09:58,792 --> 00:09:59,750
 Let's see here...

117
00:10:00,917 --> 00:10:01,875
Nope...

118
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:04,875
Nothing here...

119
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:07,709
What do we have here?

120
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,417
Ahh, that's the one!

121
00:10:18,167 --> 00:10:21,042
Now we can summon
the Eternal Dragon!

122
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,375
 Pilaf!

123
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:55,917
Did you steal
those Dragon Balls?!

124
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,500
 Mommy?

125
00:10:57,584 --> 00:10:59,459
 Emperor Pilaf...

126
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:02,709
Emperoror Pilaf...

127
00:11:03,292 --> 00:11:04,250
Emperoror Pilaf!

128
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:08,792
I have great news!

129
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:12,000
 We got it! We've recovered
the four-star Dragon Ball, sir.

130
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,667
 You did?!

131
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,959
 Finally. The boy
with the tail had it,

132
00:11:18,042 --> 00:11:20,125
but here they all are.

133
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:21,125
Take a look.

134
00:11:37,584 --> 00:11:39,584
 They're beautiful, sire!

135
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,042
They're all mine!

136
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:29,459
The Dragon Ball!
It's gone! It's gone!

137
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:31,959
Goku, you gotta
wake up! They took it!

138
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,917
The four-star ball
is gone! Gone!

139
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
They've got all
seven of them, now!

140
00:12:41,584 --> 00:12:43,042
Good, you're awake!

141
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,584
I'm exhausted.

142
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:49,917
Then wake up, 'cause
your Dragon Ball is gone!

143
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,917
No way! I hid that!

144
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,959
Oh, what if that crazy
little troll already used the

145
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:59,084
balls to summon the dragon?!

146
00:12:59,167 --> 00:13:00,250
Great!

147
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:02,834
Hey, look, the cell door's open.

148
00:13:06,042 --> 00:13:07,417
 Do you think
they forgot to close it?

149
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:09,959
 It could be another trap.

150
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,417
 Yeah, but why would
they set another trap for

151
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,917
us if we were already trapped?

152
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:20,375
 Hey, Yamcha's
right. I say we go for it!

153
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:21,917
 All right, then!

154
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:31,625
Very soon,
the world will be mine!

155
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:50,709
Have you made your wish?

156
00:13:50,792 --> 00:13:53,000
 Uh-uh...

157
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,709
Give me back my Grandpa!

158
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:01,584
Quick, get 'em!

159
00:14:08,292 --> 00:14:09,959
 Now which way?!

160
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,084
 What do
you think, Goku?

161
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:18,667
Gee, I-I don't know!

162
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,459
How did they escape
from such a well-designed trap?

163
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:24,334
You forgot to close the wall,
didn't you?

164
00:14:24,417 --> 00:14:26,709
I don't know, I thought
you were the last one out!

165
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,834
Exactly how
stupid are you guys?!

166
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,417
 Very stupid, sir.

167
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:37,459
Well. don't expect to see
any allowances this week.

168
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:40,209
And yes, you can forget
about desert as well.

169
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:41,875
 But sire--!

170
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:43,334
 Silence!

171
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:49,459
Now, let's see here...
Pinball! That's the penalty!

172
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,959
C'mon, Goku,
we're leaving!

173
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,750
 Ow, ow, ow, ow...

174
00:16:04,334 --> 00:16:08,459
Take that, you oversized
ball bearing! You lose!

175
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:17,542
You just had to open your mouth,
didn't you?!

176
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,625
Like I knew
the ball had an IQ!

177
00:16:32,042 --> 00:16:33,334
I don't wanna die like this!

178
00:16:33,417 --> 00:16:35,375
I'm not wearing clean underwear!

179
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:47,167

180
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:55,000

181
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,959
 It looks like there's
a tunnel behind that curtain!

182
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:08,917
It could be a way
out of here, or a trap.

183
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,917
 What should we do?

184
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,709
 I don't know.

185
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,375
I want my mommy...

186
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:41,000
 No! We're trapped!

187
00:17:54,459 --> 00:17:55,917
 It stopped! 

188
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:04,459
That's weird.

189
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:05,584
Are we alive?

190
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:14,417
 You know,
there's something

191
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,542
familiar about this room.

192
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,584
 No! It's the
same room we started in!

193
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:29,125
Excellent.
You're all safe. That's nice.

194
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:31,917
I was worried you wouldn't be
able to see me crowned supreme

195
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,875
ruler of the world! Well,
I've got to go make my wish.

196
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:40,000
I'll see you at my
inauguration, okay?

197
00:18:40,084 --> 00:18:41,125
Bye.

198
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,584
My hour of glory
is finally at hand!

199
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:00,917
Its time to summon the dragon!

200
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:11,834
Oh no! There's got to be
a way out of this tomb!

201
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:14,084
Goku! You have to use
the Kamehameha Wave!

202
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:17,417
I'm afraid it's our
only hope right now!

203
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,625
I can try.

204
00:19:20,209 --> 00:19:22,292
 But how do you know
about the Kamehameha Wave?

205
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,334
Never mind that, Goku!

206
00:19:24,417 --> 00:19:28,042
We need every second
we can get! Now hurry!

207
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,584
Right. I'll do it!

208
00:19:40,042 --> 00:19:43,125
Yes! It is time to call
the Eternal Dragon!

209
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,584
Ka...

210
00:19:53,667 --> 00:20:02,292
me... ha... me...

211
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:03,875
Ha!

212
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:11,709
Oops! I guess I need
a little more practice.

213
00:20:11,792 --> 00:20:14,834
Look at that hole.
It's pretty small, huh?

214
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,875
 Thanks, Goku. Move it!

215
00:20:18,292 --> 00:20:20,000
Look! There they
are right there!

216
00:20:20,709 --> 00:20:22,334
It looks like they're
about to call the dragon.

217
00:20:22,417 --> 00:20:24,417
We've got to stop them!

218
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,375
 Wait, I've got it!
Puar, you think you can turn

219
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,584
into a bat, fly down
there, and try and steal

220
00:20:29,667 --> 00:20:31,000
one of those Dragon Balls?

221
00:20:31,084 --> 00:20:32,042
Sure!

222
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,709
Great idea!

223
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,709
Oolong, go help her, now!

224
00:20:44,792 --> 00:20:46,625
Huh? Why should I?

225
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:50,250
'Cause I'll yell 'piggy'
every ten seconds until you do!

226
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:53,500
Easy now, Bulma,
just settle down!

227
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:54,417
Alright!

228
00:20:55,542 --> 00:20:56,875
Hurry up, Oolong!

229
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:01,125
 I am hurrying!

230
00:21:02,292 --> 00:21:04,125
Rise Eternal Dragon!
And hear the wish

231
00:21:04,209 --> 00:21:07,375
of he who summons you!

232
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:13,334
 Will Emperor
Pilaf's wish be granted?

233
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:16,709
Or will Puar and Oolong
be able to save our heroes

234
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:18,459
and the world?

235
00:22:18,542 --> 00:22:22,084
Find out next time
on Dragon Ball!
