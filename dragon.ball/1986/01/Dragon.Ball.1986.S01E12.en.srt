1
00:01:56,334 --> 00:01:59,625
 Previously on Dragon
Ball, Emperor Pilaf succeeded in

2
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:02,917
uniting the seven magic
Dragon Balls, and now prepares

3
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,250
to summon the Eternal
Dragon to grant his wish

4
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,500
to rule the world.

5
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,459
Come forth, Dragon!

6
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:17,125
I call upon you
to grant my wish!

7
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:23,042
 Little does the
Emperor know, two of our heroes

8
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:26,792
have taken flight in an attempt
to thwart his diabolical plans.

9
00:02:27,334 --> 00:02:29,709
 Come on, Oolong!
We have to hurry!

10
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:31,750
 How fast do
you think a pig can fly?

11
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,500
 Meanwhile, the rest
of the team watches helplessly

12
00:02:34,584 --> 00:02:38,209
from above, trapped within the
confines of their prison cell.

13
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,834
C'mon, Puar!
You're our only hope now!

14
00:02:43,917 --> 00:02:45,584
You can do it, Oolong!

15
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,250
 What's
going on, you guys?!

16
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,709
I can't see!

17
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,292
Eternal Dragon!

18
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,042
Arise!

19
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,959
 At last, the Eternal
Dragon has risen from its

20
00:03:23,042 --> 00:03:27,250
slumber within the fiery core of
the Earth. And It seems nothing

21
00:03:27,334 --> 00:03:29,209
can prevent Emperor
Pilaf from fulfilling

22
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,209
his desire for world domination!

23
00:03:31,292 --> 00:03:33,042
 Hurry, Oolong!
Hurry, Puar!

24
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,917
The fate of the
world is in your hands!

25
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:51,709
We're too late, Oolong.
The dragon's already here!

26
00:03:51,792 --> 00:03:53,375
Now what are we going to do?!

27
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,542
We can't just stand
here and watch!

28
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,709
Oh, we have no choice!

29
00:03:57,792 --> 00:03:59,417
Hey, let me see!

30
00:04:04,792 --> 00:04:06,542
I can't believe it...

31
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:09,667
It's the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen!

32
00:04:16,042 --> 00:04:21,042
 At last, my greatest
dreams are finally coming true!

33
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:26,167
Soon the whole world
will be at my beck and call!

34
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:28,000
 Wow, he's huge!

35
00:05:29,834 --> 00:05:32,459
 Who has summoned me?

36
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:37,000
Uh, that would be me. I did.

37
00:05:37,084 --> 00:05:40,084
Tell me your wish.

38
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:44,250
 But beware,
for it will come true.

39
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:50,459
We've got to do something!

40
00:05:50,542 --> 00:05:52,959
We can't just let the
whole world go to ruin!

41
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:56,834
 Speak!

42
00:05:57,459 --> 00:06:01,042
Do something, you stupid pig!

43
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:03,084
I hope he ate already!

44
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:09,167
Alright, then. I'm ready.

45
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:12,959
Whoa, this is it guys!
He's about to make his wish!

46
00:06:13,334 --> 00:06:15,292
 Now I'll
never get a date!

47
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,750
 My boyfriend!

48
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,292
 Uh, I wish for, uh...

49
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,917
Ka-me-ha-me-ha!

50
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:33,417
 Darn, that didn't work!
Kamehamehas make me hungry...

51
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,084
But, I'm not gonna give up yet!

52
00:06:36,542 --> 00:06:41,167
Ka-me-ha--!

53
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,834
 You try my patience!

54
00:06:45,542 --> 00:06:47,042
I'm sorry!

55
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,875
It just that I've
never done this before...

56
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:52,959
 Make a wish!

57
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:54,959
 Now!

58
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:57,584
 Yes, of course!

59
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,917
 My wish... how
silly of me... my wish!

60
00:07:00,334 --> 00:07:02,042
I'm a coward!
I don't want to be a hero!

61
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,000
I don't want to save
the day! This stinks!

62
00:07:04,084 --> 00:07:06,459
And these boxers are chafing!

63
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:09,459
Uh... I would
like to have supreme...

64
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:14,250
...me-ha!

65
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:18,250
I want to have the world--

66
00:07:18,334 --> 00:07:21,500
 The world's most
comfortable pair of ultra-soft--

67
00:07:21,584 --> 00:07:25,709
underwear!

68
00:07:51,917 --> 00:07:53,709
Huh?

69
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:57,584
I think that little
pervert just saved the world!

70
00:07:57,667 --> 00:08:00,584
Maybe he's not such
a coward after all!

71
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:02,834
You dolt!

72
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:07,584
 Your wish
has been granted.

73
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:39,750
All of the Dragon
Balls just flew away!

74
00:08:39,834 --> 00:08:42,375
That's what happens when
the dragon grants a wish.

75
00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:44,667
The balls are spread
all over the earth again.

76
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:48,084
What? That means the
Dragon Ball Grandpa gave me

77
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:50,125
to remember him by is gone!

78
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:54,542
 Seize him!

79
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,084
I want that
pig for dinner!

80
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,042
 The others
have escaped too!

81
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,209
I want them all!

82
00:09:04,292 --> 00:09:06,875
Exterminate! Exterminate!

83
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,334
 Hey, let's go, Puar!

84
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,292
We can take those two!

85
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,375
Or not!

86
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,292
Goku?!

87
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,792
 What are you doing?

88
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,875
I'm too hungry
to go anywhere.

89
00:09:23,334 --> 00:09:25,125
 You're too hungry?!

90
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:28,000
You're gonna be too
dead to go anywhere if

91
00:09:28,084 --> 00:09:29,459
you don't move it! C'mon!

92
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:35,000
Shu, they're heading
toward the north face!

93
00:09:35,084 --> 00:09:36,584
I'll call my dog police!

94
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:17,000
We've gotta find
Yamcha and the others.

95
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:18,792
You wanna find
those whiney goofballs,

96
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:22,917
go right ahead. I've already
saved the world once today.

97
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,584
I feel like I've
done my civic duty.

98
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,292
You mean you're
just going to leave your

99
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,917
two friends behind?!

100
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,125
Let's get outta here!

101
00:10:41,084 --> 00:10:42,750
Try thinking
positive for a change!

102
00:10:42,834 --> 00:10:45,459
And run faster,
you're falling behind!

103
00:10:49,084 --> 00:10:50,042
Think positive, huh?!

104
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,500
Fine, it doesn't work.

105
00:10:55,584 --> 00:10:57,750
Snap out of it, Goku!

106
00:10:57,834 --> 00:10:59,209
I'm too hungry...

107
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:02,709
Here they come!

108
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:05,917
 Dinner time, Goku!

109
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:16,375
Yum-yum!

110
00:11:29,792 --> 00:11:32,709
Looks like I'm
on clean-up duty.

111
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:37,584
Wolf Fang Fist!

112
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:47,542
C'mon!

113
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:48,792
Let's get out of
this stinkin' dog kennel!

114
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,334
Power Pole, extend!

115
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:45,667
They're... they're...
they're gaining on us!

116
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,334
Don't worry, I'm
an expert at running away!

117
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,875
Power Pole, extend!

118
00:12:56,792 --> 00:12:58,584
All right, so
maybe it wasn't graceful, but

119
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:00,750
at least I got us
away from the dogs.

120
00:13:00,834 --> 00:13:02,167
You know, we could
just change into

121
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,667
birds and fly out of here.

122
00:13:07,292 --> 00:13:09,000
This is just great, Goku!

123
00:13:09,084 --> 00:13:12,084
So how do you think we're going
to get over to that window, huh?

124
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:12,834
I dunno.

125
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,042
Now he tells us!

126
00:13:16,792 --> 00:13:17,375
You ready, Puar?

127
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:18,834
Okay, let's go!

128
00:13:30,834 --> 00:13:32,917
Ow, now that smarts!

129
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,292
Oh, great, more dogs!

130
00:13:40,292 --> 00:13:41,750
I need some food, bad.

131
00:13:44,292 --> 00:13:45,542
 Attack!

132
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:49,334
 Alright, drop that mutt!

133
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:53,209
 Yamcha?

134
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,875
I bet even Goku can't
blast a hole this time!

135
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,625
It's made of some weird metal.

136
00:14:27,042 --> 00:14:31,167
No big deal. Look!
There's no ceiling!

137
00:14:32,584 --> 00:14:35,667
Yes there is.
It's probably made of glass.

138
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,125
It can't be
harder than my head.

139
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:39,584
Just watch this!

140
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,667
And from the looks
of it--tempered glass.

141
00:14:55,334 --> 00:14:57,667
Well, I'm not giving up.
First, we're gonna get out

142
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,917
of here, then we're gonna find
all seven Dragon Balls again.

143
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:05,000
There won't be any
Dragon Balls for a year.

144
00:15:05,084 --> 00:15:06,459
What do you mean?!

145
00:15:06,834 --> 00:15:08,750
Yeah, what gives?

146
00:15:08,834 --> 00:15:12,625
It's all part of the legend.
Once the Eternal Dragon grants

147
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:15,334
a wish and the Dragon
Balls are scattered across the

148
00:15:15,417 --> 00:15:18,750
earth again, they become inert
for a full year. In other words,

149
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,042
you won't even be able to
tell they're Dragon Balls.

150
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,084
They'll just look
like round stones...

151
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:26,500
Are... are you... serious?

152
00:15:26,584 --> 00:15:28,250
Yikes, that's harsh.

153
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:30,667
I can't believe it...

154
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,959
Now I have to be shy
around women for another year!

155
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:36,750
 And I have to wait
another year for a boyfriend...

156
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,709
 Is this on? I wouldn't
worry your pretty, little heads

157
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:44,625
over what's going to
happen a year from now!

158
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:48,875
You're all going to
be terminated tomorrow!

159
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,750
I hope you're enjoying
your accommodations because

160
00:15:50,834 --> 00:15:54,459
I personally designed
the cell you're in! I call

161
00:15:54,542 --> 00:15:56,625
it my Easy Bake Office!

162
00:15:56,709 --> 00:15:59,959
 I wanted to see how hot
I could make a room by absorbing

163
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,500
all of the sun's rays!

164
00:16:01,584 --> 00:16:04,417
It's pleasant in there now,
but just wait until the sun

165
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:10,084
comes up! Then,
get ready to broil!

166
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:14,834
I'm going to roast you alive
and enjoy every minute of it!

167
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:16,834
That fiend!

168
00:16:16,917 --> 00:16:18,500
We've got to get out of here!

169
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:21,334
Oh, now my skin's
gonna dry up,

170
00:16:21,417 --> 00:16:23,209
and I'm gonna get
premature wrinkles!

171
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:25,834
At least you'll die with a tan!

172
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:29,084
Oh, yeah, that's right.
I'll be dead!

173
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:32,334
I don't wanna die,
I'm too young!

174
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:33,792
I am, too!

175
00:16:36,292 --> 00:16:37,875
I can't die now!

176
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,750
Oh no, oh no, oh no!

177
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,250
I'm hungry.

178
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,084
 They kind of remind
me of those little goldfish

179
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:46,959
I used to have.
And they'll die just as quickly.

180
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:53,875
 Ka-me-ha-me-ha!

181
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,209
 Ha!

182
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:01,125
--Come on you guys!
--You can do it!

183
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:07,459
That's right, struggle! Do you
two idiots really think you

184
00:17:07,542 --> 00:17:12,292
can break through three solid
feet of my super-special steel?!

185
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:19,084
He's right, it's not gonna work.
We're stuck here.

186
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:22,917
Sleep well, and I'll wake
you up early for toast!

187
00:17:32,459 --> 00:17:34,000
 Carefully, sire.

188
00:17:34,084 --> 00:17:37,542
 Ahh, there.
That's it, see?

189
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,459
Sometimes it's the small
accomplishments in life that

190
00:17:40,542 --> 00:17:42,334
--have to suffice.
-- So true.

191
00:17:42,417 --> 00:17:44,417
Of course, if it wasn't
for those kids, I'd be

192
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,709
ruling the world right now!

193
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:55,375
But come sunrise,
they'll all be french-fried!

194
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,167
Uh?

195
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,125
You think he'd at least
give us a last request...

196
00:18:13,209 --> 00:18:15,250
Well, I have a last request!

197
00:18:15,334 --> 00:18:17,625
Oolong, will you
please shut up?!

198
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,959
Request denied, glamour girl!

199
00:18:20,042 --> 00:18:21,375
 Ohh...

200
00:18:27,709 --> 00:18:30,834
 Hey, Puar,
what are you doing up there?

201
00:18:30,917 --> 00:18:32,917
Nothing, just watching the moon.

202
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,250
How can you watch the moon?

203
00:18:34,334 --> 00:18:36,792
Aren't you
worried about tomorrow?!

204
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,792
Yeah, but that's why
I'm looking at the moon:

205
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:42,334
It's soothing. Look
how full it is tonight.

206
00:18:42,417 --> 00:18:44,917
Doesn't it make you
feel all warm and fuzzy?

207
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,042
I'm a pig,
I am warm and fuzzy!

208
00:18:49,084 --> 00:18:50,792
A full moon?

209
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,792
Did you guys know that
a terrible monster comes

210
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,125
out when the moon is full?

211
00:18:56,209 --> 00:18:58,209
Oh, come on Goku,
you're making that up!

212
00:18:58,292 --> 00:19:01,042
There's no such thing. You
should put that imagination

213
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:04,667
to better use and figure out
a way to get us out of here!

214
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,375
But I'm not making it up,
Bulma!

215
00:19:06,459 --> 00:19:09,834
My Grandpa was trampled
to death by that monster!

216
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:13,584
What? Gohan, the
supreme martial arts master?

217
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:16,709
That's gotta be one
big, savage monster.

218
00:19:16,792 --> 00:19:18,125
Yeah.

219
00:19:18,209 --> 00:19:20,584
It destroyed our house
and crushed all of our trees.

220
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:22,875
 What did
it look like, Goku?

221
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:25,667
I'm not really sure,
I slept through the whole thing.

222
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,875
 What? How could you
sleep if a huge monster was

223
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:30,667
fighting your grandpa
and wrecking your house?

224
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,500
 I don't know.
The last thing I remember was

225
00:19:32,584 --> 00:19:35,292
Grandpa warning me about the
full moon and how I should

226
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:39,750
never, ever look at it.
Of course, that didn't have

227
00:19:39,834 --> 00:19:42,250
anything to do with the
monster. Grandpa was always

228
00:19:42,334 --> 00:19:44,625
saying these really strange
things, and every--

229
00:19:45,542 --> 00:19:46,959
 Hey, what
are you guys doing?

230
00:19:47,042 --> 00:19:48,375
Oh, nothing.

231
00:19:48,459 --> 00:19:49,709
Hey, Goku?

232
00:19:49,792 --> 00:19:51,875
Can I ask you a
little something?

233
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:53,292
Sure.

234
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,167
 The night your
grandfather was killed, did you

235
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,750
happen to look at the full moon?

236
00:19:57,834 --> 00:20:03,459
 Well. I think I did.
Just before I fell asleep. Why?

237
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,417
I'm getting a
little nervous...

238
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,459
You're not the only one...

239
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:09,792
I had a feeling that
Goku wasn't just an ordinary

240
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,209
kid, I think I was right.

241
00:20:13,292 --> 00:20:15,250
I'm at a loss here,
Yamcha.

242
00:20:15,334 --> 00:20:17,417
How do we find out for sure?

243
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,959
How do you find
out what for sure?

244
00:20:20,042 --> 00:20:21,875
I guess we could make
him look at the moon,

245
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:23,542
then there wouldn't
be any doubts at all!

246
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:24,750
That's true...

247
00:20:24,834 --> 00:20:26,834
But what if he...

248
00:20:26,917 --> 00:20:29,834
What if he does
turn into a monster?

249
00:20:29,917 --> 00:20:32,459
We'd end up just
like his grandpa!

250
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:35,584
Yeah, that'd be a lot of fun.

251
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:39,209
Let's not chance it.
It's far too dangerous.

252
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:40,959
I'm with you!

253
00:20:41,042 --> 00:20:43,667
Goku, be very careful
not to look at the moon!

254
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,125
 It's right above you!

255
00:20:45,209 --> 00:20:46,584
 Huh?

256
00:20:49,209 --> 00:20:50,584
Huh.

257
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,667
 I don't see what
the big deal is?

258
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,167
Are you okay, Goku?

259
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,625
Of course I am!

260
00:21:00,417 --> 00:21:02,250
You had us
scared there, kid!

261
00:21:02,334 --> 00:21:03,292
Phew!

262
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:04,959
I knew it was
just a coincidence.

263
00:21:15,792 --> 00:21:18,292
I'd suggest we run,
but I wouldn't know where!

264
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:21,167
Goku, stop it,
this isn't funny!

265
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,209
 I don't
think he's joking!

266
00:22:03,584 --> 00:22:06,167
 Oh, I hate it when
Pilaf starts snoring like this.

267
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,792
 It feels
like an earthquake.

268
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,334
 That's ridiculous!

269
00:22:17,834 --> 00:22:20,334
 Will Goku
return to his normal self?

270
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:23,250
Or will he unknowingly be
responsible for the destruction

271
00:22:23,334 --> 00:22:26,042
of Bulma, Yamcha, and
the others? Find out next

272
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:28,459
time, on Dragon Ball!
