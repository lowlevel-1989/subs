1
00:01:55,334 --> 00:01:58,167
 In search of their
sixth Dragon Ball, our three

2
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,250
adventurers, Bulma, Goku
and Oolong, now make their

3
00:02:01,334 --> 00:02:04,584
way toward Fire Mountain,
the legendary home of a

4
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:08,709
terrible giant: the Ox-King.

5
00:02:08,792 --> 00:02:11,584
How much longer
until we get there?

6
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:13,459
Not long enough!

7
00:02:13,542 --> 00:02:16,042
 Are you still scared
of that silly, old legend?

8
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:19,167
 It's not real, you know.
I mean, listen to yourself!

9
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,459
 Seriously, how
could a whole mountain

10
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:23,042
really be on fire?

11
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,542
 Great! I'm stuck
with a couple of non-believers.

12
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:29,125
Well, you just wait until
you see it for yourselves!

13
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:34,792
 I gotta admit it is
getting hotter all of a sudden!

14
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:41,875
Look at the sunset!
Is it ever bright!

15
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,167
Oh, wow! Eww.
I gotta brush my teeth...

16
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:50,125
 That isn't the sun, you
idiots, that's Fire Mountain!

17
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:52,875
No way!
I can't believe it!

18
00:02:59,292 --> 00:03:00,667
Better ease back,
my friend.

19
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,292
We don't want to
be spotted just yet.

20
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:04,292
 Right!

21
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:17,542
 In a way, I'm
glad we're almost there,

22
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,042
but in a way, I'm not.

23
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,292
 How're we
going to tell Pilaf

24
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,000
we didn't get the Dragon Balls?

25
00:03:22,084 --> 00:03:24,334
 I don't know. I'm scared.

26
00:03:24,417 --> 00:03:26,917
Yeah, just once
I'd like to hear that

27
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,167
little mutant encourage us
with words of appreciation.

28
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,917
You mean like
"Shu, Mai, just relax!

29
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,959
Some failures are to be
expected in the spy business!"

30
00:03:38,042 --> 00:03:41,042
You are too kind,
oh wise Emperor!

31
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:44,417
Let's face it, Shu,
our goose is cooked!

32
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,000
Guess I'd better update my will.

33
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:50,125
 I just hope he
hasn't installed his new

34
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:52,250
"Do-It-Yourself
Torture Chamber" yet.

35
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:59,334
So, in other words,
you have failed me once again!

36
00:03:59,417 --> 00:04:02,042
You could put
it that way, sire.

37
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,500
Yes, I guess
you could say that.

38
00:04:04,584 --> 00:04:06,500
Well, this is
the spy business.

39
00:04:06,584 --> 00:04:09,250
Some failures
are to be expected.

40
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,375
So relax! Eat! Good work!

41
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,167
You fools! You know I
don't greet failure with a

42
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,542
pat on the back!

43
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,500
 You must pay for this!

44
00:04:32,167 --> 00:04:33,500
 We're toast!

45
00:04:35,084 --> 00:04:37,167
 Why, you imbeciles!
Do you think I enjoy doing this?

46
00:05:00,084 --> 00:05:03,250
That was a shocking experience,
don't you think?

47
00:05:03,334 --> 00:05:05,459
Yeah, a real charge.

48
00:05:05,542 --> 00:05:08,250
Let's hope you two
morons have learned your lesson!

49
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:22,500
Well, there's Fire Mountain!

50
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:29,000
 Wow! I've
never seen anything like it!

51
00:05:31,834 --> 00:05:33,542
 Oohh...

52
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,500
 Uh-huh...

53
00:05:36,084 --> 00:05:37,667
 I don't know about
you guys, but I've seen enough.

54
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,417
 I'm ready to go!

55
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,625
We have to get the
Dragon Ball first, Oolong.

56
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:45,459
No silly bonfire's
gonna scare me away!

57
00:05:45,542 --> 00:05:47,709
A towering mountain
engulfed in eternal flames

58
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:49,375
doesn't scare you,
huh? Well it scares

59
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:53,375
the sausage out of me! Besides,
the evil Ox-King lives there

60
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:55,084
and he'll have our heads!

61
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:57,417
 I bet he's got the ball!

62
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,917
 Yeah, I'm sure it's up
there, probably in his castle.

63
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,125
 And it's all yours.
Just get past the fiercest

64
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:06,334
giant in the world and
pass through that wall

65
00:06:06,417 --> 00:06:07,875
of flames there, and
then you can have it!

66
00:06:08,584 --> 00:06:10,250
 Does he live
up there in the castle?

67
00:06:10,334 --> 00:06:13,084
 He did, but
they say even he can't pass

68
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:14,667
through those flames.

69
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,167
So then,
why did he start the fire?

70
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,834
No, no!
He didn't start it, kid.

71
00:06:19,917 --> 00:06:22,584
He paid some magical wizard to
create a fire to protect his

72
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:25,875
castle from thieves, right?
And then it raged out of

73
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:29,167
control, and he's been stuck
on the outside ever since!

74
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,042
You sure know a lot about it!

75
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,709
 I was a
tour guide for the local

76
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,209
Chamber of Commerce,
okay? And I just remembered,

77
00:06:35,292 --> 00:06:38,625
I forgot to clock out,
so, see you later, ha ha!

78
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,625
You're the biggest
coward I know!

79
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:43,417
 Well, I know
why you're not scared,

80
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,542
you think Goku's
gonna protect you!

81
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:48,417
But he's no match
for the Ox-King!

82
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,542
My Grandpa taught me
how to be fearless,

83
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:51,750
so I'm not scared.

84
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:52,917
 Yeah? Well
I'll show you what my

85
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,792
grandpa taught me, squirt!

86
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,292
Hey!

87
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,750
Let's let him
get a head start!

88
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:00,667
 You get
back here, you...

89
00:07:04,334 --> 00:07:05,500
 Piggy!

90
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,167
 Piggy!

91
00:07:10,542 --> 00:07:11,834
 Piggy! Piggy!

92
00:07:11,917 --> 00:07:13,500
-- Piggy!
--

93
00:07:13,584 --> 00:07:15,084
 Piggy!

94
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:20,584
Look, Yamcha!
They're on the move again.

95
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:22,834
You're right, Puar,
and they're heading straight for

96
00:07:22,917 --> 00:07:26,875
Fire Mountain. I bet that
means the sixth Dragon Ball

97
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:29,959
is up there in the
Ox-King's castle.

98
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:33,167
What?! Oh, well that
Dragon Ball's definitely lost!

99
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,375
So you don't think
they have a chance?

100
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:38,709
 Actually, they have
two chances: slim and none!

101
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,167
That Dragon Ball's
as good as gone.

102
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,334
Well, I suppose
you're probably right,

103
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:45,584
but let's stick
around for the show.

104
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:48,250
And just what
show is that, Master?

105
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:51,125
 Come on, that kid Goku
is so confident I imagine he'll

106
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:53,917
try and take on the
Ox-King. Don't you agree?

107
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,584
Mm-hmm. I suppose so.

108
00:07:56,667 --> 00:07:59,334
And there you have
it, my furry, little friend!

109
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:01,875
We finally get a chance
to watch poor, little Goku

110
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:04,125
get torn limb from limb!

111
00:08:05,792 --> 00:08:06,542
Huh?

112
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,417
What?!

113
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:21,792
Oh no! Somebody help!

114
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,584
Gross, look what I've done!

115
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:33,167
I chopped his head right off!

116
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,334
Now I've seen everything!

117
00:08:39,417 --> 00:08:42,292
I don't think she even
had her eyes open, do you?

118
00:08:45,334 --> 00:08:47,334
Hey, nice work.

119
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:49,875
I was told to never
talk to strangers!

120
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:52,417
Hey, watch out!

121
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:58,209
That girl's dangerous!

122
00:08:58,292 --> 00:09:01,375
All right, Puar, we've wasted
enough time here already.

123
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:03,750
We'd better get
back on the road.

124
00:09:07,542 --> 00:09:09,250
That girl was real cute,
Yamcha.

125
00:09:09,334 --> 00:09:11,959
So why didn't you get
scared of her and run away?

126
00:09:12,042 --> 00:09:14,834
It's only girls my
age that scare me.

127
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:25,875
I just can't stand this heat!

128
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:27,709
Whoa, be quiet!

129
00:09:27,792 --> 00:09:30,750
If the Ox-King hears us
we're dead meat, you know?!

130
00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:37,000
Boy, that sure
is a massive fire!

131
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,875
Well, the Dragon Ball's
definitely up in the castle,

132
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:46,250
but how do we
get it out of there?

133
00:09:46,334 --> 00:09:48,375
What do you say, Goku?

134
00:09:48,459 --> 00:09:51,709
Do you think you can fly up
there and get the Dragon Ball?

135
00:09:52,084 --> 00:09:54,459
 I tried that once,
and look what happened!

136
00:09:55,042 --> 00:09:56,875
Goku, you're crazy!

137
00:09:58,334 --> 00:09:59,209
I know.

138
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,834
Flying Nimbus!

139
00:10:03,084 --> 00:10:06,000
Now you've done it!
The Ox-King heard that for sure!

140
00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:14,750
Get that Dragon Ball, Goku!

141
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:16,750
Hurry back here, okay?!

142
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,125
 Wow, it's hotter
than I thought up here.

143
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:26,334
Oh well, here it goes.

144
00:10:38,042 --> 00:10:40,292
Great!
The kid's just giving up!

145
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,709
And we should
do the same

146
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:43,209
before we get ourselves killed!

147
00:10:50,042 --> 00:10:51,584
You alright there, tail?

148
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,167
What're you two doing here?

149
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:21,334
Who... us? We-We
weren't doing anything?

150
00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:26,459
Don't tell me you've come
to steal the treasures from

151
00:11:26,542 --> 00:11:30,042
my castle, huh? Have you?!

152
00:11:31,042 --> 00:11:32,459
 Uh-uh!

153
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:34,125
I swear we didn't even know
there was a castle up there!

154
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:36,084
Right Oolong? Oolong!

155
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:37,917
 Uh-Huh!

156
00:11:39,334 --> 00:11:41,792
Are you lying?!

157
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,417
 Goku!

158
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,917
Power Pole, extend!

159
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:10,334
It looks like it's going
to be tougher than we

160
00:12:10,417 --> 00:12:12,167
thought getting
into that castle.

161
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,250
 Ah-ha!

162
00:12:13,334 --> 00:12:14,334
You dummy!

163
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,209
I knew it!

164
00:12:16,292 --> 00:12:18,834
You're just stinking
treasure hunters!

165
00:12:18,917 --> 00:12:20,167
 That's not true, sir.

166
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:28,584
What do you know about truth,
you little thief?!

167
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:30,750
 Atta boy, Goku,
keep him off balance!

168
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,209
 Whoo!

169
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:38,917
It's time to get serious!

170
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,042
Flying Nimbus!

171
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,625
 Whoa! Hey! Stop that!

172
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:46,584
 Cut it out!

173
00:12:53,667 --> 00:12:55,000
Urgh, this guy's a rock!

174
00:12:57,417 --> 00:12:59,334
Are you crazy, kid?!
Get outta there!

175
00:12:59,417 --> 00:13:00,834
You can't beat the Ox-King!

176
00:13:01,292 --> 00:13:03,500
You're the Ox-King??

177
00:13:03,584 --> 00:13:05,167
 Mm-hmm.

178
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,750
So you're the great
Ox-King everyone's

179
00:13:06,834 --> 00:13:10,334
been talking about.
No wonder you're so strong!

180
00:13:10,417 --> 00:13:12,000
I know about that cloud,

181
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:13,959
and you couldn't
ride it if you stole it!

182
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:15,834
So who gave it to you?

183
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:18,834
I got it from a man who
said he was a Turtle Hermit.

184
00:13:18,917 --> 00:13:22,084
Turtle Hermit?
His name's Master Roshi.

185
00:13:22,167 --> 00:13:25,750
He was my old teacher! Do
you know where I can find him?

186
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:29,167
Hey, Bulma!
Do you think we could find the

187
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,125
place where that
Turtle Hermit lives?

188
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:33,000
The Ox-King wants to know.

189
00:13:33,084 --> 00:13:34,250
Probably.

190
00:13:34,334 --> 00:13:36,084
It's gotta be close to
that beach we were on.

191
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:37,542
Ooh, eee!

192
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:38,875
I can finally go
back to my castle!

193
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,292
Oh boy, oh boy!

194
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,500
Where did you get this
little toothpick that you

195
00:13:48,584 --> 00:13:49,417
carry on your back, here?

196
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:51,959
Oh, that's no toothpick.
That's my Power Pole!

197
00:13:52,042 --> 00:13:55,584
Cool huh? My Grandpa gave
it to me before he died.

198
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:57,542
 Hmm.
That's interesting.

199
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,084
Was his name Gohan?

200
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,084
 Mm-hmm.

201
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:01,250
 Ah-ha!

202
00:14:01,334 --> 00:14:03,750
Your grandpa Gohan
once tried to break that

203
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:05,459
toothpick on my head!

204
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:06,667
You mean you and my Grandpa

205
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,542
used to fight each other?

206
00:14:09,334 --> 00:14:11,584
It seems our little
friend knows the Ox-King!

207
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:13,334
I can't believe it, Puar!

208
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:15,167
This kid is
starting to bug me.

209
00:14:17,584 --> 00:14:19,750
Why were you and
Grandpa fighting?

210
00:14:19,834 --> 00:14:21,584
 Because
we were like brothers!

211
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:24,417
Your grandpa was the first
pupil chosen by Master Roshi,

212
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,000
and I had the honor
of being the second!

213
00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:29,417
Ahh, so you're Gohan's boy.

214
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,042
Yeah! My name is Goku!

215
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,417
That's a fine name!

216
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,042
"Goku!"

217
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:39,250
That explains why
Goku is so strong!

218
00:14:39,334 --> 00:14:40,875
I should have
been nicer to him.

219
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,000
I hope he still wants to go
find the Dragon Balls with me.

220
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:46,417
All right, that's enough
talk about the good old days.

221
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,042
There's something important
I want to ask of you, Goku.

222
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,125
 Yeah?

223
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:53,209
Old Master Roshi
has in his possession a

224
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,750
very powerful fan
made out of a palm leaf,

225
00:14:55,834 --> 00:14:58,000
called the Bansho Fan.

226
00:14:58,084 --> 00:14:59,542
 It's the only
thing that will extinguish

227
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:03,167
Fire Mountain. Will you use
the Flying Nimbus to go to him

228
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,250
and borrow the fan for me?

229
00:15:05,334 --> 00:15:06,500
Yeah, sure.

230
00:15:06,584 --> 00:15:08,875
And could you do
something for me?

231
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,917
Hm! Yes!
Anything you ask.

232
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,875
We're collecting these,
and I think you have one.

233
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:15,959
Hey!

234
00:15:16,042 --> 00:15:17,750
I think I've seen
one in my castle!

235
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,667
Yes, of course you can
have it my new, little friend.

236
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,167
Aw, thanks!

237
00:15:22,917 --> 00:15:24,667
 Atta boy, Goku!

238
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,959
The kid saved my bacon!

239
00:15:27,042 --> 00:15:28,334
I see!

240
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:30,667
So that's what those
Dragon Balls really look like!

241
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,792
 I was expecting
them to be bigger.

242
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,792
I'll be back just
as soon as I can!

243
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:37,417
Wait! There's
something you should know!

244
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,167
Why, just yesterday I sent
my only daughter ChiChi

245
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,167
to retrieve the
Bansho Fan for me.

246
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,584
But now I'm worried,
'cause I feel something awful

247
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:49,750
has happened to her. Please,
Goku. Find my ChiChi, and

248
00:15:49,834 --> 00:15:51,959
bring her back safely to me.

249
00:15:52,042 --> 00:15:53,334
ChiChi?

250
00:15:53,417 --> 00:15:56,750
Yes. She's a bit
of a coward but--Ahh...

251
00:15:56,834 --> 00:15:59,167
Say Goku, how would
you like to marry her?

252
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,959
Uh... marry?

253
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,834
Here's a picture of ChiChi.

254
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,125
I'll do my best to find her.

255
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:15,750
Wow! All things considered,
she's quite a looker!

256
00:16:18,334 --> 00:16:19,542
This isn't good!

257
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,209
Are you thinking what
I'm thinking, Yamcha?!

258
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:25,417
Yeah, I'm dead meat
if that girl's not okay!

259
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:28,792
Don't you worry Mister Ox-King,
I'll bring her back!

260
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:31,500
Good luck, son!

261
00:16:31,584 --> 00:16:33,250
And be careful, Goku!

262
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,417
 Puar, the next time
I try to smack the daughter of

263
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,500
some huge giant,
please, stop me!

264
00:16:45,584 --> 00:16:47,584
Hey, there she is!

265
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:50,084
 Uh-oh! She
hasn't moved a muscle!

266
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:51,375
 Come on, Puar!

267
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:56,334
Hey kid! Wake up!
You can't be dead, please!

268
00:16:56,417 --> 00:16:58,875
 Ahh, she's
breathing Puar! She's alive!

269
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,042
Don't shoot, ChiChi!
I'm a friend!

270
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,167
Huh? How do you
know my name is ChiChi?

271
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,750
Uh, well let's just say
I'm a secret admirer of yours.

272
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:14,417
I didn't want to
hurt you earlier,

273
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,834
but you left me no choice.

274
00:17:16,917 --> 00:17:18,417
Oh!

275
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,000
 If you really want
to know the truth, my darling,

276
00:17:21,084 --> 00:17:26,542
I'm in love with you. Ever since
I first set eyes on you. Truly.

277
00:17:27,834 --> 00:17:30,042
Wow!
You're in love with me?

278
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,417
Oooh! With me?!

279
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,542
Of course!
I really am!

280
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,125
 Are you
telling the truth?

281
00:17:37,209 --> 00:17:40,792
Just look into my face.
Can't you see it for yourself?

282
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,500
See?

283
00:17:42,584 --> 00:17:44,542
Oh my, you look funny!

284
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,834
Is that, uh, tooth
gonna grow back in?

285
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,000
Remember the
Ox-King, Yamcha!

286
00:17:50,084 --> 00:17:52,084
We don't want to
blow this little charade!

287
00:17:52,417 --> 00:17:57,209
You know, you're the first boy
to say that he loves me, hehe!

288
00:17:57,292 --> 00:17:59,459
Why does that not surprise me?

289
00:17:59,542 --> 00:18:02,875
Oh, boy! I wonder if
papa will approve of him?

290
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:06,375
I wonder if I'm even old
enough to have a boyfriend?!

291
00:18:06,459 --> 00:18:07,417
 Let's get outta here!

292
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,500
 Right!

293
00:18:08,584 --> 00:18:10,959
Oh my!
This is all happening so fast!

294
00:18:11,042 --> 00:18:13,042
I just don't
know what to think!

295
00:18:18,834 --> 00:18:20,959
What the... Hey,
I wonder where he's going?

296
00:18:21,042 --> 00:18:23,875
I thought he loved me...

297
00:18:25,542 --> 00:18:27,667
 I know! He
must be the shy type.

298
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,500
 How romantic...

299
00:18:31,459 --> 00:18:33,167
Hey, are you ChiChi??

300
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,417
Yes I am, but I don't
think I know who you are.

301
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,750
You're the second
boy today who

302
00:18:37,834 --> 00:18:39,584
knows my name is ChiChi.

303
00:18:42,959 --> 00:18:44,209
 You must love me too!

304
00:18:44,292 --> 00:18:47,125
Well, you seem like a
pretty nice person to me.

305
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,834
 But I'm not
even sure my papa will

306
00:18:48,917 --> 00:18:50,834
let me have a boyfriend yet!

307
00:18:50,917 --> 00:18:53,917
Well, don't worry about that,
you're dad sent me here!

308
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,667
I'm supposed to help
you find Master Roshi

309
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,834
so we can borrow the Bansho Fan!

310
00:18:57,917 --> 00:19:00,542
Really? That's so sweet of you.

311
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,584
Well, hop on
to my Flying Nimbus,

312
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:04,500
'cause we really
should get going.

313
00:19:04,584 --> 00:19:06,417
You mean,
I can actually ride on

314
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,417
this thing without falling?

315
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,334
Well, sure, but you
do have to have a pure heart.

316
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,167
Oh, that's okay!

317
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,125
When your dad's the Ox-King
you always behave well.

318
00:19:19,584 --> 00:19:21,042
Need some help there?

319
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:23,625
Nope.

320
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,709
Well, I'm up!

321
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:36,167
Hey, what happened to you?

322
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,625
Well, you grabbed my
tail and I lose all my power

323
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:40,167
when somebody does that.

324
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,542
It's the only thing
I just can't stand!

325
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,000
 Sorry. I didn't know.

326
00:19:47,709 --> 00:19:50,209
Well, it seems like
our amazing little friend

327
00:19:50,292 --> 00:19:52,292
has a weak point after all.

328
00:19:53,334 --> 00:19:54,709
 Here we go!

329
00:19:57,042 --> 00:19:58,417
Try to relax
and stand up.

330
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,667
Here! Take my hand!

331
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,167
Well, what are
you thinking Yamcha?

332
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,167
Should we follow them?

333
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,792
Don't worry about it, Puar.

334
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:08,042
He's gonna have to
come back to get the sixth

335
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,250
Dragon Ball from that castle.

336
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,334
And we'll be waiting
right here for those fools.

337
00:20:13,417 --> 00:20:15,750
And after they get the
seventh ball for us,

338
00:20:15,834 --> 00:20:17,459
then we'll make our move.

339
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,542
And I'll grab that
little monkey tail of his

340
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,750
with my Wolf Fang Fist!

341
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:36,542
Oh, so you are a girl!
I really wasn't sure at first.

342
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:38,209
You jerk!

343
00:20:46,709 --> 00:20:50,292
Do you think Goku's going
to find my little ChiChi?

344
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,917
He'd better,
if he knows what's good for him!

345
00:20:57,834 --> 00:20:59,750
Gee whiz,
you didn't have to knock me

346
00:20:59,834 --> 00:21:01,750
off the cloud you know!

347
00:21:01,834 --> 00:21:03,417
Well with your manners,
you'd think you

348
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,125
just crawled out of the woods!

349
00:21:05,209 --> 00:21:06,625
 Well I did!

350
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:17,750
We might never find
that Turtle Hermit out

351
00:21:17,834 --> 00:21:19,375
in the middle of nowhere.

352
00:21:19,459 --> 00:21:21,584
Maybe we should stop and
ask somebody for directions.

353
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,834
Whatever you say.

354
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,500
Uh, what are you giggling about?

355
00:21:27,584 --> 00:21:30,500
Oh, about some
hunk I just met.

356
00:21:31,334 --> 00:21:33,042
 Is that all
girls ever think about?

357
00:21:34,709 --> 00:21:37,667
Excuse me, can you tell me
where Master Roshi lives?

358
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,542
Master Roshi? Yeah!
You just keep going in that

359
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:43,000
direction and you can't
miss his little island!

360
00:21:43,084 --> 00:21:45,334
Thank you! Bye-bye now!

361
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:47,917
I've never seen
a fish like that.

362
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:54,125
Wow! That must be it Goku!

363
00:21:54,209 --> 00:21:56,542
I think you're right.
Let's go see.

364
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,959
 Hey! Master Roshi!

365
00:22:02,042 --> 00:22:03,459
 Hello there!

366
00:22:04,167 --> 00:22:05,959
Hi.

367
00:22:06,042 --> 00:22:08,584
Hop on down, kid!
I had a feeling I'd be seeing

368
00:22:08,667 --> 00:22:10,500
you again some day.

369
00:22:10,584 --> 00:22:13,792
Uh, this is the
great Master Roshi?

370
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:16,000
Yep. that's him.

371
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:18,792
How you doin'?

372
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:21,334
Good! For an old coot!

373
00:22:22,334 --> 00:22:25,250
 Our hero has found
Master Roshi, but will he be

374
00:22:25,334 --> 00:22:28,625
able to fan out the
flames of Fire Mountain?

375
00:22:28,709 --> 00:22:31,334
 Join us next
time for Dragon Ball.
