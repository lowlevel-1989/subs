1
00:01:51,292 --> 00:01:53,084
 Hoo, hoo, hoo!

2
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:03,875
 On the last
episode of Dragon Ball,

3
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:07,000
Goku and Bulma decided
to team up and search for

4
00:02:07,084 --> 00:02:09,875
the remaining four
Dragon Balls together.

5
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,375
The adventure continues

6
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,500
as they speed head-
long into the unknown.

7
00:02:15,584 --> 00:02:16,292
 Bulma, stop!

8
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:17,875
I just saw a snake.

9
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:19,875
That oughta tide us
over until dinner.

10
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:21,500
That is so
disgusting, Goku!

11
00:02:21,584 --> 00:02:23,125
If you don't wanna gross
people out, you're gonna

12
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:25,750
have to stop eating frogs
and snakes and things.

13
00:02:25,834 --> 00:02:26,542
 Really?

14
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:28,000
 Mm-hm.

15
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:29,959
How about lizards?

16
00:02:30,042 --> 00:02:32,375
 Nope, eating
lizards is nasty too, kid.

17
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:33,625
You're just going
to have to toughen up.

18
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:41,209
 Yeah!

19
00:02:41,292 --> 00:02:42,625
This looks like a
good place to camp!

20
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:44,667
 There's no need to
live outside like savages.

21
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,750
I have my Dyno-caps, remember?

22
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,334
 Huh?

23
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:49,917
Don't tell me you have a tent
in one of those things, Bulma?

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,750
Well, no, not exactly.

25
00:02:51,834 --> 00:02:53,917
 I don't like
those magic witch-bombs.

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,917
Grandpa said never to use magic
unless it's to help someone.

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,875
 Oh, well I am
going to help someone, silly.

28
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:02,959
She's pretty and has blue hair.

29
00:03:03,542 --> 00:03:04,542
 What's the matter?

30
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:05,584
You're not afraid, are you?

31
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:08,625
 Here it goes!

32
00:03:13,834 --> 00:03:14,792
 Huh?

33
00:03:16,084 --> 00:03:18,250
 There we go! Now
doesn't that look cozy?

34
00:03:18,334 --> 00:03:20,334
Come on, Goku.
What are you waiting for?

35
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,500
 Uhhh...

36
00:03:22,584 --> 00:03:24,542
 Get away
from its mouth, Bulma!

37
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,375
I'll protect you
from this monster!

38
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:29,500
 Thanks, that's noble
of you, but it's just a house.

39
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:30,542
See?

40
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,125
 Bulma!

41
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:36,042
You made it light, but it's
still dark outside!

42
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,292
 Chill out.

43
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,084
It's a little something
we call "electricity".

44
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:42,000
Were you transported from
the stone age or what?

45
00:03:42,084 --> 00:03:43,250
 Huh?

46
00:03:43,334 --> 00:03:45,542
Oh, wow!

47
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,209
This is amazing!

48
00:03:54,917 --> 00:03:55,875
Goku...

49
00:03:57,084 --> 00:03:58,834
Oh, no, that guy's
trapped and he's trying

50
00:03:58,917 --> 00:04:01,542
to break the glass by
playing that horrible music!

51
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:04,500
 Lilah, I love you.

52
00:04:04,584 --> 00:04:06,375
 Kiss me, you fool.

53
00:04:07,584 --> 00:04:08,417
 Oh, Chad!

54
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,292
I've waited so long for this!

55
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,000
 I'll love you
forever, my darling!

56
00:04:16,084 --> 00:04:17,167
 What's this thing?

57
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,042
 One little
kiss... One kiss...

58
00:04:21,917 --> 00:04:23,834
 Yes! Almost there!

59
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,459
 You shut up!

60
00:04:31,542 --> 00:04:32,875
 Hey, are you
getting hungry, Bulma?

61
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,084
 Huh?

62
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:36,167
 Well, you're drooling.

63
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,709
 Now I'm embarrassed!

64
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:41,500
Hey, what's that
horrible smell?

65
00:04:41,584 --> 00:04:44,042
Ugh, Goku, you need a bath!

66
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,917
 Uhhh...

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,667
what's a bath?

68
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,542
 Oh, kid!

69
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:51,000
I can't believe you're asking!

70
00:04:51,084 --> 00:04:52,875
I guess I gotta show you...

71
00:04:55,584 --> 00:04:58,334
 We civilized
people call that a "towel"!

72
00:04:58,417 --> 00:04:59,834
Now let's get this over with!

73
00:04:59,917 --> 00:05:00,875
Hop in!

74
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,042
 Hmm...

75
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,250
So this is a bath?

76
00:05:04,334 --> 00:05:05,459
 Look at you!

77
00:05:05,542 --> 00:05:07,167
You're supposed to
cover up the front!

78
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:07,875
 Hm?

79
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:08,917
Like this?

80
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:14,917
 Why are you putting
this fluffy stuff in my hair?

81
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,167
 It's called shampoo.

82
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,959
And I'm putting it in
your hair to clean it.

83
00:05:18,042 --> 00:05:19,917
I don't do this
very often, you know.

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,875
You should consider
yourself lucky!

85
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,250
 No wonder your
hair stands up,

86
00:05:23,334 --> 00:05:24,667
it's never been washed.

87
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,959
There, that's better. Yeah!

88
00:05:27,334 --> 00:05:28,584
What in the world?!

89
00:05:28,667 --> 00:05:30,875
Whoa! How does
this thing stay on, kid?

90
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,709
I thought it was
attached to your pants!

91
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:34,584
What do you do,
super-glue it to your butt?

92
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,292
 Ow!

93
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:37,792
What are you doing?! That hurts!

94
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,209
 I'm trying
to take this thing off

95
00:05:39,292 --> 00:05:40,792
so I can wash
your back properly.

96
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,167
 Here, that's okay.

97
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,834
I can wash my own back.

98
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:46,667
Huh?

99
00:05:47,917 --> 00:05:49,709
 See? It's easy!

100
00:05:57,209 --> 00:05:58,250
No way!

101
00:05:58,334 --> 00:06:00,209
It moves!

102
00:06:00,292 --> 00:06:03,959
 That means
it's... it's real!

103
00:06:04,042 --> 00:06:07,000
Goku, uh, why do you
have a tail growing?

104
00:06:07,084 --> 00:06:08,542
Well, I don't
really know why.

105
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,125
I just know that
all boys have 'em.

106
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:12,542
It's no big deal, it's
just the way we are.

107
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:13,750
Huh?

108
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:15,125
 Maybe he's right.

109
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,500
I've never actually
seen a boy take a bath

110
00:06:17,584 --> 00:06:19,334
before so I guess
I can't be sure.

111
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:22,042
Maybe they just keep them tucked
in their pants or something.

112
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,834
How bizarre!

113
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,125
I can't believe
I'm a teenager

114
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:26,834
and I'm just now finding out.

115
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:28,750
Well, I guess I
shoudn't say all boys,

116
00:06:28,834 --> 00:06:30,542
because my Grandpa
didn't have a tail.

117
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,125
See? See?

118
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:34,750
Normal men don't have tails or
your grandpa would've had one!

119
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:37,584
But my Grandpa was a
very odd fellow, you know!

120
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:39,375
You're the
real odd ball!

121
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:42,125
So that was
a bath, huh?

122
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:44,000
A bath sounds
so wonderful.

123
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:51,250
 Aah, there's nothing
like a long hot bath

124
00:06:51,334 --> 00:06:53,542
to melt a woman's cares
away, that's for sure!

125
00:06:55,084 --> 00:06:56,042
 Mmm!

126
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:58,542
Hm?

127
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,334
What are you doing?!

128
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:08,292
Can't you see that
I'm taking a bath, kid?!

129
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,500
Yeah. I was going to
help you scrub your back.

130
00:07:10,584 --> 00:07:12,375
You know, since you
don't have a tail.

131
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,167
No way, I can
scrub my own back!

132
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,792
Now beat it! Shoo, shoo!

133
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,625
Gosh, I don't
get it, Bulma.

134
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:20,792
You were going to
help me scrub my back.

135
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,125
 Goku,
you're a little kid

136
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:23,542
and I'm practically
a full-grown woman!

137
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:24,625
There's a big difference!

138
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:25,834
There is?

139
00:07:25,917 --> 00:07:27,417
 Yes, there certainly is!

140
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,834
But we're not going to
get into that right now...

141
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:32,834
Hey, you don't have
to be ashamed, no way.

142
00:07:32,917 --> 00:07:34,625
What in the world
are you talking about?

143
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:35,709
I happen to be one of the most

144
00:07:35,792 --> 00:07:37,167
beautiful girls
that you'll ever see!

145
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,042
So what do I have to
be ashamed of, buster?

146
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,334
 Not having a tail?

147
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:43,625
That's it, get
out of my face.

148
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,917
But I want to help.

149
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,334
Beat it!

150
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:49,209
Oh, come on.

151
00:07:52,292 --> 00:07:53,750
 I can't take it anymore!

152
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:56,125
Get out of my
bathroom and stay out!

153
00:07:56,209 --> 00:08:00,084
And for the last time,
I don't want a stupid tail!

154
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:01,959
Uhhh!

155
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,250
It's about time I got
a little bit of privacy.

156
00:08:05,334 --> 00:08:07,250
 Bulma.

157
00:08:07,334 --> 00:08:09,084
I'm hungry.

158
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:10,959
 Goku!

159
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:18,584
 Well, did you bring
me a Dragon Ball, Shu?

160
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:19,625
 No, sire.

161
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:21,792
I-I got real hungry
so I came back.

162
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,667
 Imbecile! You won't
get so much as a bone

163
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,584
until you bring
me another Dragon Ball!

164
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:27,209
 But, sire!

165
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:29,125
I'm so hungry that
I can't even think!

166
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:30,834
 That's a
good thing, Shu.

167
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:32,500
You'll have to trust me on that.

168
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:37,875
 Ahh, look how it
sparkles so brilliantly!

169
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:39,875
And yet it's only
one piece to the puzzle!

170
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:42,000
I have to have those
other six Dragon Balls!

171
00:08:42,792 --> 00:08:44,709
 But why, sire?

172
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:45,834
Isn't one enough?

173
00:08:45,917 --> 00:08:47,709
Of course one
isn't enough!

174
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,292
If I pulled out all of
your teeth except one,

175
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,375
would that one be
enough to chew with?! No!

176
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:55,625
 If I cut off all
of your paws except one,

177
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:58,084
would that one be
enough to run with?! No!

178
00:08:58,584 --> 00:08:59,792
Do you see my
point now, Shu?

179
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,375
I can't rule the
world with one ball!

180
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:03,125
Can you understand that?!

181
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,625
Yes, I think so!

182
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:06,292
But isn't the world
an awfully big place?

183
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:07,959
How can one person
rule the whole thing?

184
00:09:08,042 --> 00:09:10,667
Well, you have to be
able to delegate, Shu,

185
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,000
and I've always been good at
telling other people what to do.

186
00:09:13,084 --> 00:09:15,709
Bossing people around is
one of my strong points.

187
00:09:15,792 --> 00:09:18,167
Right! That's true, sire!

188
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,250
 There are
other requirements, Shu!

189
00:09:20,334 --> 00:09:23,625
You have to be able to
think big! Not small, big!

190
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:26,459
And though small in
stature, I think very big!

191
00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:28,917
I have all the qualities
needed to rule the world!

192
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,792
What I don't have are
those other six Dragon Balls!

193
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:32,834
You dolt!

194
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:37,750
 Uh, oh!

195
00:09:41,042 --> 00:09:43,584
Heh, heh!

196
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:44,875
Did you hear that?

197
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,917
Huh?!

198
00:09:46,834 --> 00:09:48,667
I think you did...

199
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,042
No, Sire! It wasn't me!

200
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,084
I swear!

201
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,375
 We'll see about that!

202
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:55,375
 Huh?

203
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,417
 Ha-Ha! Ha ha ha!

204
00:10:04,042 --> 00:10:05,792
Note to me:
I must remember

205
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,834
to move that button
to a closer spot!

206
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:09,209
Please let me go, sire!

207
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:10,917
I didn't do anything!

208
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Are you saying
that I would be capable

209
00:10:13,084 --> 00:10:14,709
of such a gross emission?

210
00:10:14,792 --> 00:10:16,417
 Oh, no! Please, sire!

211
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,375
I'll not tolerate
this kind of outburst

212
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:19,875
from one of my agents!

213
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:22,542
I'm afraid the time has
come to trim the staff a bit!

214
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:29,792
Don't chop me up!

215
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:32,375
I admit it, sire! I did it! I
tooted, I farted, I passed gas!

216
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:34,834
Guilty as charged,
woo-hoo! Let out a stinker!

217
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,250
That's better.

218
00:10:38,334 --> 00:10:39,792
I'll let this one go
because you were honest.

219
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,584
Just make sure it
doesn't happen again!

220
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:43,292
Is that clear, Shu?!

221
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,709
 Yes, sire!
I'll try to contain myself!

222
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:46,917
 Emperor Pilaf!

223
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,792
That sounded like Agent Mai.

224
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,292
Sire, Agent Mai
reporting as ordered.

225
00:10:57,209 --> 00:10:58,959
 Hmm, well,
what's the news?

226
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:01,167
Did you bring me back
another Dragon Ball?

227
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,334
 No, Sire,

228
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:04,334
But I do have some
valuable information.

229
00:11:04,417 --> 00:11:06,750
Is it about the
Dragon Balls? Well?!

230
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:07,792
Yes.

231
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:12,417
 A deep-cover
agent of ours landed

232
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,667
in a place known
as Skull Valley.

233
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,500
Just before he
left his spy-plane,

234
00:11:16,584 --> 00:11:19,459
he reported seeing a mysterious
light with a bright glow.

235
00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:22,417
 Was the
light a Dragon Ball?

236
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,667
 We don't know, sire.

237
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,959
He disappeared!

238
00:11:25,042 --> 00:11:26,834
We never heard from him again!

239
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:29,750
Hmm, take Shu with you

240
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:31,917
and see if there's a
Dragon Ball over there.

241
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,834
Sire! I have
obedience school today!

242
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:36,459
Nevermind that!

243
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:39,792
We need a disposable agent
like you on this mission, Shu!

244
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,875
Now go get me a Dragon Ball!

245
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:43,750
--Yes, sir!
--Yes, sire...

246
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:49,250
So this is it, huh?

247
00:11:50,834 --> 00:11:51,834
Eww, yuck!

248
00:11:51,917 --> 00:11:53,417
This bread stuff
doesn't have any flavor!

249
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,917
And my soup's bitter too!

250
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,459
 That's not
soup, it's coffee!

251
00:11:56,542 --> 00:11:58,500
And how do you expect
to grow big and strong

252
00:11:58,584 --> 00:11:59,959
if you don't eat right!

253
00:12:01,042 --> 00:12:02,042
You know you're right!

254
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,917
Thanks for the advice, Bulma!

255
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:06,000
Huh?!

256
00:12:06,084 --> 00:12:07,792
Where do you think you're going?

257
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:12,000
 I'm going
to go get some food

258
00:12:12,084 --> 00:12:13,084
that will make
me big and strong!

259
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:14,334
I'll bring some back!

260
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:15,875
 You might wind
up being food yourself

261
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:17,459
if you're not careful out there!

262
00:12:17,542 --> 00:12:18,709
I wouldn't do it!

263
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:43,834
Wow.

264
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:45,417
Slim pickings so far.

265
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,000
Bulma can probably eat this
whole centipede by herself!

266
00:12:48,084 --> 00:12:50,792
I'm going to have
to do better than that.

267
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,667
 Hm?

268
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:55,000
A bird!

269
00:12:55,084 --> 00:12:56,459
Wow!

270
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,334
 There's Skull Valley.

271
00:12:59,417 --> 00:13:00,709
It's right below us.

272
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:02,750
Can we go back now and
just say that we went?

273
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:04,625
 Nah, we better
check it out.

274
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:18,542
 Geronimo!

275
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,542
 Shu! Be quiet.

276
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:21,334
 Sorry.

277
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:22,792
 Come on.

278
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:31,542
 I want to chew on one of
these bones, but I'm too scared!

279
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,834
 Let's just make sure
we leave with our own bones.

280
00:13:33,917 --> 00:13:35,709
 Yeah.

281
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:39,667
 Huh?!

282
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,750
What is that?!

283
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:42,459
I don't know. It
could be a Dragon Ball.

284
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:43,917
Let's check it out.

285
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:52,250
 Huh?

286
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,042
The kid likes to jump!

287
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,250
He's a hopper alright!

288
00:13:58,334 --> 00:14:00,542
Beat it, kid,
before you get hurt!

289
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:01,625
You beat it!

290
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:02,792
Look, I'm not going anywhere!

291
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,292
That's my big birdy!

292
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:07,000
I saw it first, so
you two just stay away!

293
00:14:07,084 --> 00:14:08,417
What in the world
is he talking about?

294
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,625
Beats me.

295
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:11,500
Kid, I think I hear
your mommy calling.

296
00:14:13,334 --> 00:14:15,167
 Huh?!

297
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:23,250
 Those lights
weren't Dragon Balls!

298
00:14:23,334 --> 00:14:24,750
 No kidding!

299
00:14:24,834 --> 00:14:26,500
 This is great! Now
there's enough for all of us!

300
00:14:26,584 --> 00:14:29,459
Ahh! Alright! Yum!

301
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:47,292
 This is it, Mai!

302
00:14:52,084 --> 00:14:53,875
That was close!

303
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:00,334
 Hm?!

304
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:02,209
Hey, my bird! It's getting away!

305
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,667
Power Pole, extend!

306
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,542
Dog-gone it. This
bird's rock hard.

307
00:15:39,792 --> 00:15:41,209
 Bulma, I'm back!

308
00:15:41,292 --> 00:15:44,084
 Huh, he's alive after
all. Well, I'll be darned.

309
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,084
Hm?

310
00:15:47,167 --> 00:15:49,084
If you think this
appetizer looks good,

311
00:15:49,167 --> 00:15:51,084
take a look at the main course!

312
00:15:54,584 --> 00:15:56,375
 Huh? Bulma?

313
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,584
Bulma, are you
serious about not eating?

314
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:02,125
This is looking pretty good!

315
00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:03,375
 You're
grossing me out, Goku!

316
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:05,375
I can't believe
you're gonna eat that!

317
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,334
 Oh, my gosh!
That is so disgusting!

318
00:16:10,417 --> 00:16:12,000
You need to brush
your teeth, kid!

319
00:16:12,084 --> 00:16:13,542
 Huh?

320
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,125
 I don't want to smell
your nasty ol' wolf-breath!

321
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:17,125
Wow! What a soft bed!

322
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:18,500
I could bounce
like this all night!

323
00:16:18,584 --> 00:16:21,209
Come on, Bulma,
there's room for both of us!

324
00:16:21,292 --> 00:16:23,709
Room? What are you
talking about, kid?

325
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:25,584
We're not sleeping together.
You're sleeping on the floor.

326
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:28,750
Are you serious?

327
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:29,834
 Yes!

328
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:31,042
You're used to
roughing it, aren't you?

329
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,792
A guy who eats
centipedes shouldn't mind

330
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,375
sleeping on the floor.

331
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:36,375
I don't mind, but I
hope it's not because

332
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:38,125
you're still mad
about not having a tail.

333
00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:39,584
Get it through
your thick head:

334
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:41,250
I don't want a tail!

335
00:16:43,584 --> 00:16:45,209
 There we go.

336
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:46,500
 Hey...Goku...

337
00:16:46,584 --> 00:16:48,500
why did you live with
your grandpa anyway?

338
00:16:48,584 --> 00:16:50,709
I mean, what
happened to your parents?

339
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:52,292
I'm not sure
what happened.

340
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,334
My Grandpa found me
on a mountainside on a

341
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:56,000
little bed of moss
when I was just a baby

342
00:16:56,084 --> 00:16:57,875
so he picked me
up and took me home.

343
00:16:59,542 --> 00:17:01,334
 Did you know that
you don't have to keep a tail

344
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:03,209
just because
you're born with one?

345
00:17:03,292 --> 00:17:05,167
Some dogs actually
get their tails cut off

346
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,667
while they're still small.

347
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,750
You shouldn't have let
them do that to you, Bulma.

348
00:17:08,834 --> 00:17:09,834
You're no dog.

349
00:17:09,917 --> 00:17:11,584
I'm not talking
about me, lame-brain!

350
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:12,792
I never had a tail! Hm?!

351
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,917
I don't know what
planet this kid's from,

352
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,084
but it's not Earth!

353
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,292
I'm up...

354
00:17:38,084 --> 00:17:39,875
 I guess it's not
time to get up yet...

355
00:17:40,584 --> 00:17:43,584
Ha! See! I told her there
was enough room for both of us!

356
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:56,959
 Hm? Strange...It feels
like there's nothing ther--

357
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:04,959
Huh?! Wha--Wha--?!

358
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,667
I-It's your balls,
Bulma! They're gone!

359
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,042
What?! You're
kidding me?! How?!

360
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,334
-- U-uh, I don't know!
-- Please, no!

361
00:18:13,917 --> 00:18:16,375
Thank goodness!
They're all here, Goku.

362
00:18:16,459 --> 00:18:18,834
You must have been dreaming.
Man, you really had me scared.

363
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:31,500
My gosh, Bulma. Wow, how
long is this going to take?

364
00:18:31,584 --> 00:18:33,875
Look, nobody asked
for your commentary!

365
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:35,917
Besides, you didn't have to
wake us up at this insane hour!

366
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:40,875
Early birds! You can
have your nasty, old worm.

367
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:42,709
 Well, you're moving
so slow I wouldn't be surprised

368
00:18:42,792 --> 00:18:44,792
if you turned into a turtle.

369
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,375
 Goku, you
can go out in public

370
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,084
with your hair sticking out in
every direction if you want to,

371
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:49,334
but not me.

372
00:18:51,084 --> 00:18:52,584
Would you like to
have coffee with me?

373
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:54,959
Nah, it doesn't taste good
and it makes me feel funny!

374
00:18:55,042 --> 00:18:56,834
 I'm gonna go exercise!

375
00:18:58,167 --> 00:18:59,959
 Mm!

376
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,959
 Hmm!

377
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:34,834
Whoa!

378
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:36,292
 What in the world?!

379
00:19:38,417 --> 00:19:40,709
Ow, that's a new pain...

380
00:19:40,792 --> 00:19:43,792
Bulma, wow! You really
did turn into a turtle!

381
00:19:44,709 --> 00:19:47,667
Boy, I guess this kinda
changes our plans a bit, huh?

382
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,125
 Hmm?

383
00:19:49,209 --> 00:19:52,959
 Goku? Who were you
talking to out there, kiddo?

384
00:19:53,042 --> 00:19:54,375
What?!

385
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:57,000
 Hm? Who are you?

386
00:19:57,084 --> 00:19:58,125
 I thought he was you!

387
00:19:58,209 --> 00:20:00,084
 Wha-?

388
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:03,334
Strange... A tortoise
shouldn't be living around here!

389
00:20:03,417 --> 00:20:05,417
Aren't you supposed to
be living by the sea?

390
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,834
Yeah.

391
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:09,792
And I'm very concerned
about being so far from home.

392
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,500
By the way, do you
have any salt water?

393
00:20:12,584 --> 00:20:14,375
Sure, we'll
fix you right up.

394
00:20:20,042 --> 00:20:24,167
Good seawater.
Aromatic, yet full bodied.

395
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,875
 Yeah, I think
it's an eighty-seven.

396
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,292
Nope, eighty-six!

397
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,500
 Really? Are
you sure about that?

398
00:20:30,584 --> 00:20:34,000
Mm-hm. I
know my water.

399
00:20:34,084 --> 00:20:35,792
So, what are
you doing here?

400
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:38,209
Well to make a long
story incredibly short:

401
00:20:38,292 --> 00:20:41,834
I'm lost! It's that simple. I'm
lost! I've been trying to find

402
00:20:41,917 --> 00:20:46,209
my way back to the
sea for over a year now.

403
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:47,875
That's so sad!

404
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:49,917
And you're still not
anywhere near the sea.

405
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Hold on, let me go check
my map. Wait here a second.

406
00:20:56,334 --> 00:20:59,042
Bad news: you're
still a hundred miles away!

407
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,334
Great, that'll
take me twenty years!

408
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:03,500
Gosh! That sounds
like a long time.

409
00:21:03,584 --> 00:21:05,542
Hmm, I wish there was a
way that we could help you.

410
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,375
Yeah. Hey, I know!

411
00:21:07,459 --> 00:21:09,667
Would you like me to carry
you to the sea, Mister Turtle?

412
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,334
 Why, yes! Thank you!

413
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:13,042
Are you nuts?!

414
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,417
But you just said that
you wished we could help!

415
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,500
So why don't we just
take him to the sea?

416
00:21:17,584 --> 00:21:19,292
I didn't mean
that for real, Goku.

417
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:20,709
We're on an adventure.

418
00:21:20,792 --> 00:21:23,875
We don't have time to transport
a beached turtle, okay?

419
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:25,584
You're impossible!

420
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:28,084
 I'm impossible?!
What do you mean by that?!

421
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:30,292
 Well, if we're so pressed
for time, why did you just spend

422
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:31,792
the whole morning in
front of the mirror

423
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,042
worrying about your hair?!

424
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,000
Fine, help the stupid
turtle if you want!

425
00:21:35,084 --> 00:21:37,875
I can find the Dragon
Balls by myself! Hmph!

426
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:40,959
Gosh, are women like
this where you come from?

427
00:21:41,042 --> 00:21:43,042
No, most have tails.

428
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:46,125
 Sure, be that way!

429
00:21:46,209 --> 00:21:49,209
I hope you get a backache,
you little twerp! Hmph!

430
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,209
Man! What a geek!

431
00:21:53,292 --> 00:21:54,875
I don't need his
stupid help, anyway!

432
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:58,084
I can handle whatever
comes my way on my own!

433
00:21:59,542 --> 00:22:00,500
Hm?!

434
00:22:06,709 --> 00:22:09,750
 Stop! Stop,
or I'll run you down!

435
00:22:09,834 --> 00:22:11,584
I mean it, Goku!

436
00:22:11,667 --> 00:22:13,625
 Oh, we better
stop. That girl scares me.

437
00:22:16,459 --> 00:22:17,709
Careful!

438
00:22:17,792 --> 00:22:19,625
You could mess up your
hair riding on that thing!

439
00:22:19,709 --> 00:22:22,000
 Knock it off.
I decided to forgive you.

440
00:22:22,084 --> 00:22:24,459
 Huh? What's
the matter? Scared?

441
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:26,959
 Me?
Scared? Give me a break!

442
00:22:27,042 --> 00:22:29,000
Let's just go find
those Dragon Balls.

443
00:22:29,084 --> 00:22:30,250
 Join us
again next time for

444
00:22:30,334 --> 00:22:32,959
another exciting
episode of Dragon Ball!
