1
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,459
 The adventure
continues as Goku and Bulma

2
00:01:54,542 --> 00:01:55,959
have decided
to put the hunt for

3
00:01:56,042 --> 00:01:58,250
the remaining
Dragon Balls on hold,

4
00:01:58,334 --> 00:02:00,125
so that they can
help a lost turtle

5
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:03,000
find its way back to the sea.

6
00:02:03,084 --> 00:02:07,000
I hope we get there soon,
I'm really getting hungry!

7
00:02:07,084 --> 00:02:10,334
You know, this is
probably the nicest thing

8
00:02:10,417 --> 00:02:12,334
anyone has ever done for me.

9
00:02:12,417 --> 00:02:14,959
Aw, hey.
It's no big deal really!

10
00:02:15,042 --> 00:02:17,417
Well, I just
wanted to thank you.

11
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,292
Gosh. I think
I'm going to cry.

12
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:20,542
Spare me, please.

13
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:21,875
Just concentrate
on where you're going

14
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:24,209
so we can get there
while we're still young.

15
00:02:24,292 --> 00:02:26,209
Why are you
always complaining?

16
00:02:26,292 --> 00:02:28,542
Why don't you try thinking
happy thoughts, Bulma?!

17
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:29,917
 Hold on.
Let's see if there's

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
anything to be happy about.

19
00:02:32,084 --> 00:02:33,459
Hey. Not too bad.

20
00:02:33,542 --> 00:02:35,417
Just two more miles. Hm!

21
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,917
Wow! We're close.
That's great.

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Huh?

23
00:02:39,084 --> 00:02:41,625
I can't wait to
get back in the water.

24
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:44,875
 Hm.

25
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,000
Looks like dinner's on the way.

26
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,084
 Hold it right there!

27
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:06,209
Oh, yeah. Humans
give me heartburn

28
00:03:06,292 --> 00:03:08,959
but I love turtles. So look.

29
00:03:09,042 --> 00:03:10,792
 Hand it
over or you're dead.

30
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,625
Goku! You heard him!

31
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:14,250
Give him the turtle, quick.

32
00:03:14,334 --> 00:03:15,250
Pppft!

33
00:03:15,334 --> 00:03:16,334
 Eh?!

34
00:03:16,417 --> 00:03:18,042
Huh?! Ha!

35
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:21,542
I guess a little heartburn
never hurt anybody.

36
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:24,750
All right. Have it
your way. Die if you want.

37
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:26,750
You idiot! You're going
to get us killed!

38
00:03:26,834 --> 00:03:27,792
Give it to him.

39
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:31,167
I don't care
what this guy says. No.

40
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,417
Are you out of your
freakin' mind, kid?

41
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,125
 He's my friend, Bulma.

42
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:37,375
 Not for long.

43
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:42,667
 I think
you better hop down.

44
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,417
--
-- Huh?

45
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:50,959
It's just you and me now!

46
00:03:51,042 --> 00:03:54,084
Ha-ha!
You think you're real cute.

47
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:56,459
 Don't you, monkey boy?!

48
00:03:57,209 --> 00:03:59,292
You should have
saved your skin,

49
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,667
while you had the chance.

50
00:04:04,167 --> 00:04:06,584
--
--

51
00:04:07,792 --> 00:04:09,459
 You missed me.

52
00:04:12,584 --> 00:04:13,917
 Over here, bear breath!

53
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,250
 Huh?!

54
00:04:15,334 --> 00:04:17,250
Forget about him, Turtle.
Let's get out of here.

55
00:04:18,834 --> 00:04:22,500
I like you, kid.
Too bad you have to die.

56
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:27,375
 Yoo hoo!

57
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,667
 Huh?!

58
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,500
 One. Two. Three.

59
00:04:35,584 --> 00:04:36,709
 Huh?

60
00:04:43,834 --> 00:04:45,250
 Yay!

61
00:04:46,417 --> 00:04:48,375
 Well. That's that!

62
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:51,417
 Yeah... sure.
Whatever you say, kid.

63
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,625
 Are you okay?

64
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:55,959
Yes, I'm fine, thanks to you.

65
00:04:56,042 --> 00:04:58,292
So some creatures think
you're good to eat, huh?

66
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:01,250
What?! Oh, my!
No, no! How disgusting.

67
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,334
Turtle meat is
tough and poisonous.

68
00:05:03,417 --> 00:05:05,834
You'd puke.


69
00:05:05,917 --> 00:05:07,125
 That's what I thought!

70
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:08,542
Some people will eat anything.

71
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:09,542
Not me, though.

72
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,209
Ready, guys?! Let's go.

73
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:13,959
 Onward to the sea.

74
00:05:14,042 --> 00:05:15,334
 Hey, wait up.

75
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:22,625
 There it is, Goku.
I found it.

76
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:28,042
Huh?! No way. Wow.

77
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:30,542
 Look! Look!
We're really here!

78
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:34,334
It's huge.
And blue! And beautiful!

79
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,250
 Whoa.

80
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:40,625
The sea!

81
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:42,459
Isn't it beautiful, Goku?!

82
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:43,959
 Yeah! It's incredible.

83
00:05:44,042 --> 00:05:47,042
I never dreamed that a place
like this really existed!

84
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,959
 I was starting
to wonder myself.

85
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:52,542
It's been so long.
Thanks for bringing me back.

86
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:56,750
 Hey! Sure! No problem.
It was a lot of fun.

87
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:59,167
Well, I'd better get going.

88
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,125
You sure do have
a great home, Turtle!

89
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:04,584
Well, I never would have
made if it wasn't for you!

90
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:05,625
Thank you.

91
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:07,542
 Hey, anytime.

92
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,750
Would you mind waiting here?

93
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:11,875
I have a gift I'd like
to bring you to repay you

94
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,834
for all you've done for me.

95
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:15,084
A gift?!

96
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,084
What kind of gift
could a Turtle have, huh?

97
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:20,459
You'll see.
I'll be back soon! Mm, hm.

98
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:24,875
It's not a stupid shell,
is it?! Hey, hold on.

99
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:30,084
Ah... He's gone.

100
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:41,875
Hey. Watcha doing there, kid?!

101
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,917
I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

102
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,834
Ew! Yucky.
This water's salty.

103
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,625
 Whoa!

104
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:54,584
 Hail, Pilaf.

105
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:56,459
Hail, the Emperor.

106
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,667
Hail, Pilaf.

107
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:03,834
Make way for Emperor Pilaf,

108
00:07:03,917 --> 00:07:07,167
the supreme ruler of the world!

109
00:07:08,084 --> 00:07:09,500
Thank you! Thank you!

110
00:07:09,584 --> 00:07:11,292
-- Emperor Pilaf!
-- Huh?

111
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,209
 Emperor Pilaf!

112
00:07:13,292 --> 00:07:15,125
What?! Spit it out.

113
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:16,334
Did you get the Dragon Ball?!

114
00:07:16,417 --> 00:07:17,542
 Not exactly.

115
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,292
It's like this.
There was a slight problem

116
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,959
with the information, Sire.

117
00:07:21,042 --> 00:07:22,084
And?!

118
00:07:22,167 --> 00:07:23,750
It was bogus. Yeah.

119
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:25,875
We were nearly killed
by a huge pack of wolves.

120
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,250
And then we crashed, Sire.

121
00:07:27,334 --> 00:07:29,292
Some crazy kid...
he kicked our plane.

122
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,667
-- Silence.
-- It was horrible.

123
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,750
 Aah!

124
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:33,542
I'm sick of your
lame-brained excuses!

125
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,375
Now get out of here
and get that Dragon Ball,

126
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:37,917
if it's the last thing
you do! Understand?!

127
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,917
 Sir!

128
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:42,417
 Huh?!

129
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,125
 The hotline.

130
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:45,834
Hello?!

131
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:47,792
What's that you say?!

132
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,167
 You're kidding?!
And where is it?!

133
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,334
I see. Well done.

134
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:54,292
Another Dragon Ball.
We're in luck.

135
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,875
An old hermit
named Roshi has it.

136
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,667
No one's even guarding it!

137
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,417
But... does he
have any wolves?!

138
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,750
 No, you dunder-head.

139
00:08:00,834 --> 00:08:02,375
He lives on an island
in the middle of the sea.

140
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:03,709
Wolves don't go there.

141
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:05,334
We'd better be careful.

142
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:07,209
Could be another bum-steer!

143
00:08:07,292 --> 00:08:09,792
Never mind that!
Go get me that Dragon Ball!

144
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,334
 Yes, sir.

145
00:08:13,542 --> 00:08:14,834
-- Huh?
-- Sire!

146
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:17,000
 You've never come
with us on a mission before.

147
00:08:17,084 --> 00:08:18,209
You keep screwing up.

148
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:20,667
I can't trust you two
on your own anymore.

149
00:08:27,334 --> 00:08:29,000
 Engaging thrusters.

150
00:08:31,084 --> 00:08:33,334
 Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

151
00:08:33,417 --> 00:08:37,875
Please fasten your seatbelts
and remain seated at all times.

152
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:40,417
Forget the seatbelts.
It's too narrow in here.

153
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,834
Yeah, it's a
little stuffy.

154
00:08:41,917 --> 00:08:43,667
That's cause there's
one too many in here.

155
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,000
What did you say?!

156
00:08:45,084 --> 00:08:47,000
I said "I read you
loud and clear."

157
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,625
 Ahh! I get so relaxed
when I'm on the beach.

158
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:57,209
 Yeah! You're not
talking nearly as much.

159
00:08:57,292 --> 00:08:59,959
 Huh?
Hey, what's that?!

160
00:09:00,042 --> 00:09:02,125
Whatever it is,
it's moving toward us.

161
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:03,125
 It's the turtle!

162
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,250
And he's got
someone on his back.

163
00:09:06,042 --> 00:09:07,667
 Wow. It's like
you've got super-vision

164
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,542
or something!
Pretty cool, Goku.

165
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,750
Hey, Turtle. Over here.

166
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:14,042
 Doesn't he
realize that they're

167
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,125
the only one's on the beach?

168
00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:18,084
 Ahoy, there. Heh, heh.

169
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:20,625
Sorry I kept you waiting.

170
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:23,084
I had to go get my Master.

171
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:25,250
Man! Check that guy out.

172
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,542
Well, hello there, kids.

173
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:34,167
 Hi. How's it going?!
Welcome ashore.

174
00:09:35,084 --> 00:09:36,500
What a cool outfit.

175
00:09:36,584 --> 00:09:39,000
 Kids, I want to thank
you for helping my turtle!

176
00:09:39,084 --> 00:09:41,959
It was our pleasure, Mister.

177
00:09:42,042 --> 00:09:43,959
I'm Roshi!
The turtle hermit.

178
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,834
Uh... A turtle hermit?

179
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:48,292
Which one of
these kids helped you?

180
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,500
It's that little boy, there.

181
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:52,917
You're a very brave boy.

182
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,417
I have a gift
I want to give you

183
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,250
as a token of my gratitude.

184
00:09:56,334 --> 00:09:57,750
Hear that, Goku?

185
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,459
Come, Magic Carpet.

186
00:10:07,542 --> 00:10:09,167
 Magic carpet?!

187
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,250
 What in the world
is a magic carpet?

188
00:10:11,334 --> 00:10:12,959
 What's a magic carpet?

189
00:10:13,042 --> 00:10:16,375
It's a carpet you can sit on
and fly anywhere you want.

190
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,917
They're not real, though.

191
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,709
At least,
I don't think they are.

192
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:25,250
 Hey!
Uhh, Master. Hold on.

193
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:28,042
You took the Magic
Carpet to the cleaners.

194
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,625
Hey, that's right. You've got
a good point there, Turtle.

195
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:31,542
Hmm.

196
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,709
I knew it.
They're not real.

197
00:10:33,792 --> 00:10:35,625
The other option
is the Flying Nimbus,

198
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:38,667
but am I really
ready to part with it?!

199
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,625
Why not?! If you can
ride it, it's yours.

200
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,875
Come to me, Flying Nimbus!

201
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:47,625
He's odd.

202
00:10:47,709 --> 00:10:50,000
He's not odd. He's nuts.

203
00:10:50,084 --> 00:10:52,250
 Now where
is that cloud?!

204
00:10:56,584 --> 00:10:59,917
 Oh, there it is.
It's about time. See!

205
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,959
She's a beauty, isn't she?!

206
00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:04,084
-- Hm?!
-- Whoa!

207
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:05,834
 Look, Bulma!
Isn't it neat-o?!

208
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:07,959
Yeah! How strange!

209
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,042
Wow.

210
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,125
Don't be afraid!
She's as sweet as candy.

211
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:13,000
-- Hm.
-- Gosh.

212
00:11:13,084 --> 00:11:16,334
It's so light and puffy.

213
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:18,167
Do you mind if
I have a taste?!

214
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,709
You don't eat it,
you little baboon.

215
00:11:20,792 --> 00:11:22,125
What does this thing do?!

216
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:23,959
If you can manage
to sit on this cloud

217
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:25,834
it can fly you
wherever you want.

218
00:11:25,917 --> 00:11:27,167
There's got to be
some kind of hitch.

219
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,792
You wouldn't
be giving it away.

220
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,084
Something's wrong
with it, right?!

221
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:32,959
Hm?! There's nothing
wrong with this cloud.

222
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:35,667
Hey. Can I try to ride it now?

223
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,792
Sure, why not?!
But... I must warn you.

224
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,459
You have to be pure of
heart to ride this cloud.

225
00:11:41,542 --> 00:11:42,625
 Hm?

226
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:44,084
Yep, otherwise it won't
let you get on it.

227
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:45,459
It's picky that way.

228
00:11:45,542 --> 00:11:46,917
Wow.

229
00:11:47,584 --> 00:11:50,917
Here. Let an old man
show you how it's done!

230
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,084
Are you okay, Master?!

231
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:03,459
You must have done
something naughty.

232
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:05,084
Be quiet.

233
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:06,750
Now let me try it.

234
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,500
 Huh?!

235
00:12:10,584 --> 00:12:11,834
 Wow.

236
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:14,000
Yeah! Alright.
I did it! I did it!

237
00:12:14,084 --> 00:12:15,792
-- I really did it!
-- He did it, Master.

238
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:18,459
I'll be darned.
There goes my cloud.

239
00:12:18,542 --> 00:12:19,875
I did it! Woo hoo!

240
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,500
 Shut up, Shu!
Pay attention.

241
00:12:43,584 --> 00:12:45,209
 Sorry, Sire.

242
00:12:45,292 --> 00:12:47,459
Is there any sign
of the island yet?

243
00:12:47,542 --> 00:12:49,042
 Negative.

244
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,792
Hey. There it is.
Take her down.

245
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,334
 Right away, Sire!

246
00:12:54,417 --> 00:12:55,542
 Huh?

247
00:13:10,917 --> 00:13:13,125
 Wow. Nice house
for a turtle-hermit.

248
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,750
 Yeah, I wonder
if he's hiring?

249
00:13:14,834 --> 00:13:17,250
You imbecile!
Let's get on with it!

250
00:13:17,334 --> 00:13:19,750
Get the Dragon Ball
and don't you dare screw up!

251
00:13:19,834 --> 00:13:20,917
 Sir!

252
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,209
 Now follow me.

253
00:13:28,042 --> 00:13:31,042
Telegram. Hello?!

254
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,459
 Special delivery.
Telegram! Hello?!

255
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:34,917
Is anybody home?!

256
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,084
Good. The place is empty.

257
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,209
 I got a great idea.
Let's just break in.

258
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:45,042
"Break in"?!

259
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,042
I like your style, Shu.

260
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,959
But when in the presence
of a brilliant mind,

261
00:13:49,042 --> 00:13:51,584
there is seldom need
for brute force.

262
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:54,500
Now. Where did I
put that thing?!

263
00:13:57,917 --> 00:13:59,459
Oh, yeah. Here it is.

264
00:13:59,542 --> 00:14:02,042
 My Universal Key is
just the thing for this job.

265
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,459
We could smash
right in, but hey!

266
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:06,459
That's not the way I operate.

267
00:14:07,584 --> 00:14:09,625
 There. That's it.

268
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:11,292
Hey. What's the deal?!

269
00:14:15,042 --> 00:14:18,209
Look Emperor! This window
was open the whole time!

270
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:19,209
Huh?

271
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:22,042
I'll open the door... Wait.

272
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,084
Ah! Eh...

273
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:31,667
Yeah, whoa!

274
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:35,709
Wee!

275
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:38,375
All right! Yeah. 

276
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:39,750
Whoa!

277
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,042
Whoa! Whoopie!

278
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,459
Whoopie!

279
00:14:49,542 --> 00:14:51,375
Hey, down there.

280
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:53,542
Whoa!

281
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:56,209
Wow. It's great.
Thanks. I love it.

282
00:14:56,292 --> 00:14:57,500
 You fly
that thing like you've

283
00:14:57,584 --> 00:14:59,292
had it your whole life.

284
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:02,250
 See ya.

285
00:15:03,334 --> 00:15:04,792
Hey, yo.
What about me?!

286
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,000
Hm?

287
00:15:06,084 --> 00:15:08,000
Aren't you going to
give me a gift, too?!

288
00:15:08,084 --> 00:15:09,125
Whatd'ya say?!

289
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:10,917
Did this young lady
help you as well?!

290
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,917
Oh, no. Just the boy.

291
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,417
 Hey! What about
the seawater I gave you?!

292
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,750
 Hmm...

293
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:18,750
I think I have to side
with Turtle on this one...

294
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,792
But I could be persuaded
to change my mind...

295
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,167
 For instance...

296
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,667
if, uh, you were to
let me see your underwear...

297
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,459
You wanna see my...

298
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:31,292
Master. What are you doing?!

299
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,792
 You can't be serious!

300
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,584
Eh huh!

301
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:38,542
Have you forgotten
your code, Master.

302
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,334
Please. That's wrong.
Dead wrong.

303
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:41,875
Oh hush up, will ya?

304
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:43,875
Can't a master take
a break from training

305
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:45,667
and have a little fun?

306
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:49,375
Now I understand why you
couldn't ride your cloud...

307
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:51,084
Bite your tongue.

308
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:53,209
This is so embarrassing...

309
00:15:53,292 --> 00:15:56,209
I can't believe I'm...
doing this...

310
00:15:57,917 --> 00:15:59,334
 Aah!

311
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:03,084
Ta da!

312
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,667
There. Done. 
That's it.

313
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,292
Oh, my eyes...
I think I'm blind...

314
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,792
I'm gonna faint...

315
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,959
It serves you right!

316
00:16:14,042 --> 00:16:16,750
All right.
So, where's my gift at?!

317
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:18,959
Oh, right! Sure! The gift!

318
00:16:19,042 --> 00:16:22,000
Well... I have one in mind!

319
00:16:22,084 --> 00:16:24,292
 Let's see,
I could give her the...

320
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,417
No, not that,
the wheels fell off...

321
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,792
Well, what about the...

322
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,292
 Huh?

323
00:16:32,334 --> 00:16:34,500
Nevermind. Nevermind!
I know what I want!

324
00:16:34,584 --> 00:16:36,834
Mm. Yeah? You do? What?

325
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:38,334
That! I want that!

326
00:16:38,417 --> 00:16:40,542
That thing right there that's
hanging around your neck!

327
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:44,250
What? This?! You sure
you want this old thing?

328
00:16:44,334 --> 00:16:47,625
I found it washed up on
my island a long time ago.

329
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:50,334
Oh, it's beautiful...

330
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,334
 The three-star ball.
I can't believe it.

331
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:55,542
 Hey! Goku!

332
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:56,917
 Huh?

333
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,334
 Come here! I've got
something to show you.

334
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,125
 Okay!

335
00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:01,125
What?

336
00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:03,209
Look. It's another
Dragon Ball!

337
00:17:03,292 --> 00:17:04,875
Ah...!

338
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,459
It sure is, isn't it!

339
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:08,375
Our fourth Dragon Ball.

340
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:09,917
A Dragon...
What'd you call it?

341
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,375
So aren't you glad
that we decided

342
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:13,584
to help the turtle
now?! It paid off.

343
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:15,792
I sure am.
You were so right.

344
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,459
And now just three
more then, wish time!

345
00:17:18,542 --> 00:17:19,459
 Yeah.

346
00:17:19,542 --> 00:17:22,000
What?! That thing
grants wishes?!

347
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:23,709
 What a great day.

348
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,792
Thank you.
We really love our gifts.

349
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,959
You're a kind-hearted
and generous man.

350
00:17:28,042 --> 00:17:29,542
Thanks so much.

351
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,709
I never said
you could have the ball.

352
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:33,750
 But you said you were
going to give me a gift.

353
00:17:33,834 --> 00:17:35,459
Can I have it? Please?!

354
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:37,209
Aw, come on.

355
00:17:37,292 --> 00:17:38,625
There! Huh?

356
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,000
Ehhh...!

357
00:17:41,084 --> 00:17:43,792
 I give up.
It's yours. Take it.

358
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,084
Yay!

359
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,334
Woo-hoo-hoo! Oh-ho!

360
00:17:53,084 --> 00:17:54,209
 Goodbye, Turtle Hermit.

361
00:17:54,292 --> 00:17:55,625
-- So long. 
-- Thanks a lot.

362
00:17:55,709 --> 00:17:57,167
-- Bye, bye.
-- See ya later.

363
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,125
 Boy! I tell ya,
these kids nowadays.

364
00:17:59,209 --> 00:18:00,542
They're like little piranhas.

365
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:01,709
I was lucky
to get out of there

366
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:03,625
with my staff and sandals.

367
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:13,459
 Man! I never thought
things would be going this well!

368
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:15,667
We only need
three more Dragon Balls.

369
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,292
I guess it was
meant to be, kiddo.

370
00:18:19,459 --> 00:18:22,584
Ahh! Wow! I wish
Grandpa could see me now.

371
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,417
 Hold on Bulma,
I'm coming!

372
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,334
What's going on
in here? What's wrong?!

373
00:18:30,417 --> 00:18:33,375
M-M-My underwear
was here on the floor...

374
00:18:33,459 --> 00:18:36,000
Uh... I'm afraid to look.

375
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,959
Awe...

376
00:18:40,042 --> 00:18:42,917
They're not there!

377
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,792
 Oh, that
means on the beach...

378
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,500
that old man... oh boy...

379
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:50,084
Oh, is that all?
Well that's okay, Bulma.

380
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:52,209
That's right where I put 'em!

381
00:18:52,292 --> 00:18:54,000
What are you talking about?

382
00:18:54,084 --> 00:18:56,834
After I took 'em
off this morning.

383
00:18:56,917 --> 00:18:58,917
Are you saying that
you took my underwear off

384
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,042
while I was sleeping
this morning?! Huh?!

385
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:02,084
 I sure did.

386
00:19:02,167 --> 00:19:03,125
These underwear?!

387
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:05,917
Yep! They're the ones. Huh?

388
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:08,292
 What are you
doing, Bulma?!

389
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,292
 Ow, ow! Owie! Ow!

390
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,459
Huh?

391
00:19:20,542 --> 00:19:21,959
Hmm. Mm.

392
00:19:22,042 --> 00:19:24,959
 This is disgusting. Ugh!

393
00:19:25,042 --> 00:19:27,417
 Darn it.
Where is that Dragon Ball?!

394
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,459
 It's not up here, Sire.

395
00:19:29,542 --> 00:19:31,084
Or down here.

396
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:33,167
 It's not in the
kitchen either, Emperor.

397
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,334
It's possible that
someone tipped him off.

398
00:19:35,417 --> 00:19:37,292
I wonder... Wait here!

399
00:19:39,334 --> 00:19:40,292
 Huh?

400
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,292
 Hey, there.
Nice day, isn't it?!

401
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,500
Huh?

402
00:19:47,084 --> 00:19:48,792
You'd better tell me
what I want to know,

403
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,042
or I'll make a
green handbag out of you!

404
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,292
Okay...

405
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,542
Where did this
"Roshi the Turtle Hermit" go?

406
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,625
Master Roshi?
He's right there, buddy.

407
00:19:56,709 --> 00:19:57,875
Right where?! Aaah!

408
00:19:57,959 --> 00:19:59,584
 Shu! Mai!

409
00:20:00,709 --> 00:20:02,167
 What is it?!

410
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,584
 Keep me covered.

411
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:06,417
I don't think we've met. Hi.

412
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,875
Hi. Now hand it over.
The Dragon Ball.

413
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:10,000
What ball?!

414
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,209
 Yeah!
That's right, needle-nose.

415
00:20:11,292 --> 00:20:13,167
 You heard the man.
Now cough it up.

416
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,084
Dragon...? Oh, I remember.

417
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:18,959
I just gave it to that
pretty girl on the beach.

418
00:20:19,042 --> 00:20:20,334
 Are you kidding?!

419
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:22,167
 Seriously.
She wouldn't leave me alone

420
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,667
until I gave it to her.

421
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,917
She was nuts about that ball
because of some crazy wish.

422
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,125
 Huh?!

423
00:20:28,209 --> 00:20:29,250
-- Huh?!
-- Doesn't sound good.

424
00:20:29,334 --> 00:20:31,292
I want to know
where that girl is at.

425
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,500
 I don't know.
But I just said goodbye to her

426
00:20:33,584 --> 00:20:34,500
-- by the sh--shore...
-- She couldn't have

427
00:20:34,584 --> 00:20:36,625
gotten too far!
Come on! Let's go.

428
00:20:36,709 --> 00:20:38,084
 Right.

429
00:20:39,584 --> 00:20:42,292
Engaging amphibious
transformation.

430
00:20:46,084 --> 00:20:47,542
Uh, hello there! Yoo, hoo.

431
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,417
Would you mind
giving us a little push?!

432
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,209
 Anything to
get you off my island,

433
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:52,750
you blue-faced dwarf!

434
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:53,875
 Hurry up!

435
00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:55,750
 Yeah, yeah!
Keep your hat on.

436
00:20:59,584 --> 00:21:01,042
Oopsie, Daisy!

437
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,584
 Bon voyage.

438
00:21:05,917 --> 00:21:08,750
 Goodbye!
Enjoy the bottom of the sea.

439
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,459
 Thank you.

440
00:21:10,542 --> 00:21:13,042
Those three deserve
the hole I put in their side.

441
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:16,250
Too bad.
It was a nice plane.

442
00:21:16,334 --> 00:21:18,834
 Shu! Step on it.
We're going too slow.

443
00:21:18,917 --> 00:21:20,709
 Eye, eye, skipper.

444
00:21:22,084 --> 00:21:23,542
 Ready and presto.

445
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,542
 Now that's what
I call house-cleaning.

446
00:21:27,792 --> 00:21:29,084
 Don't scare me
like that, Bulma.

447
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:30,875
 Okay!
I'll warn you next time.

448
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:34,167
I guess we'll both
take the Flying Nimbus.

449
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,500
It'll be faster.

450
00:21:35,584 --> 00:21:37,167
 But didn't Master Roshi
say you have to be

451
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,250
pure of heart to ride
the Flying Nimbus?

452
00:21:39,334 --> 00:21:40,542
What's that supposed to mean?!

453
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:43,292
I'm probably the
purest person you know.

454
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,417
 All right.

455
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,917
 Go ahead!
Give it a try.

456
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,834
 Uh...! Uh!

457
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:51,875
Pure, huh?! 

458
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:54,250
Ooh! Now my
clothes are dirty.

459
00:21:54,334 --> 00:21:57,959
Darn it. I didn't want to
ride that stupid cloud anyway.

460
00:22:04,834 --> 00:22:05,792
 Kind of slow, huh?!

461
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,042
 Oh, just hush up.

462
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,334
Nobody likes
a show-off, you know.

463
00:22:10,542 --> 00:22:12,084
There's that smell again...

464
00:22:12,167 --> 00:22:13,417
 Man! That's toxic.

465
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,625
 Oh, yeah. Well,
whoever smelt it dealt it.

466
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:16,667
Right, Shu?!

467
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,084
 Yes, Sire.

468
00:22:18,167 --> 00:22:19,500
Huh?!

469
00:22:19,584 --> 00:22:21,625
 As the villains
sink with the setting sun,

470
00:22:21,709 --> 00:22:23,667
our heroes'
adventure continues.

471
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,000
Join us again
next time as Goku and Bulma

472
00:22:26,084 --> 00:22:27,459
once again
further their quest

473
00:22:27,542 --> 00:22:30,459
to unite the seven
magic Dragon Balls.
