1
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,109
 Goku, wait for me!

2
00:02:08,942 --> 00:02:11,692
 Goku and Bulma have
already collected four of the

3
00:02:11,775 --> 00:02:13,567
seven magic Dragon Balls.

4
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,150
Now, with only three
more to find before

5
00:02:16,234 --> 00:02:18,609
they can make their wish,
our heroes race towards

6
00:02:18,692 --> 00:02:21,067
the location of the fifth
Dragon Ball, which, according

7
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,025
to Bulma's radar, isn't far off.

8
00:02:24,942 --> 00:02:27,359
 Whoo, hooo! Ha ha ha!

9
00:02:27,442 --> 00:02:29,567
Hey, Squirt! Pay
attention to where you're going!

10
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,442
You're not invincible, you know!

11
00:02:45,317 --> 00:02:47,734
 Wow! Are you okay, Bulma?

12
00:02:47,817 --> 00:02:51,359
Ugh. Does it look
like I'm okay, you twerp?

13
00:02:53,859 --> 00:02:55,650
 I guess not.

14
00:02:59,192 --> 00:03:01,150
Bulma, look, the
Dragon Ball is glowing! 

15
00:03:03,025 --> 00:03:04,692
You know what this
means, don't you?

16
00:03:04,775 --> 00:03:08,025
The fifth ball must be
really close. This is great!

17
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:10,734
Hey, look over there!
Do you see what I see?

18
00:03:10,817 --> 00:03:12,650
 A village!
Good eye, kid.

19
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,525
Do you think it's there?

20
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:16,567
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

21
00:03:29,234 --> 00:03:31,692
 I wonder
where everybody is.

22
00:03:31,775 --> 00:03:33,567
 Huh?

23
00:03:34,484 --> 00:03:36,317
 Let's see
what the radar says.

24
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,025
Yep, the fifth
Dragon Ball's here alright.

25
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:40,567
Something's weird.

26
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,692
 It's too quiet.

27
00:03:41,775 --> 00:03:43,609
Maybe this village
has been deserted.

28
00:03:43,692 --> 00:03:46,400
 No, people are
here. I can feel it.

29
00:03:46,484 --> 00:03:47,692
 Are you sure, Goku?

30
00:03:47,775 --> 00:03:49,859
It seems like an
old ghost town to me.

31
00:03:49,942 --> 00:03:51,942
Yeah, I'm positive.

32
00:03:52,025 --> 00:03:53,900
 If you say so.

33
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,692
 Hello, in
there! Come on out!

34
00:03:56,775 --> 00:03:59,567
 Hello? Is
anybody home? Hello?

35
00:04:00,775 --> 00:04:02,484
 I think I just saw
someone peeking at us

36
00:04:02,567 --> 00:04:04,734
from that window over there.

37
00:04:04,817 --> 00:04:06,609
 This is getting freaky.

38
00:04:07,275 --> 00:04:09,692
There must be some reason
why they won't come out here,

39
00:04:09,775 --> 00:04:11,150
and I'm gonna find out!

40
00:04:15,567 --> 00:04:19,734
 Hello? I know
you're in there. Hello?

41
00:04:19,817 --> 00:04:21,734
I hope they're not
in some sort of trouble.

42
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,900
 Oh, yeah.
That did the trick.

43
00:04:28,984 --> 00:04:30,942
Ever consider
using the handle?

44
00:04:31,984 --> 00:04:33,817
 Hmm?

45
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:36,400
 Huh?

46
00:04:43,609 --> 00:04:46,942
Aah, oww!
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

47
00:04:48,234 --> 00:04:51,609
Ahh. Oh, no.
It's just as I feared...

48
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:53,442
Oh, I should have known...

49
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:55,025
 Huh?

50
00:04:55,109 --> 00:04:58,109
 What'd you do that for?!
That didn't tickle, you know!

51
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,025
Oh, please forgive
me, Mister Oolong!

52
00:05:01,109 --> 00:05:03,275
I know it was foolish of
me to try and attack you,

53
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,984
but I'd rather die
than lose my daughter!

54
00:05:06,067 --> 00:05:07,650
Oh, please don't take
her! I'll do anything!

55
00:05:07,734 --> 00:05:08,984
-- Huh?
-- Oolong?

56
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:10,942
Hey, I think you've got
me mixed up with someone.

57
00:05:11,025 --> 00:05:11,900
 My name's Goku.

58
00:05:11,984 --> 00:05:13,775
 It's not him, Dad.

59
00:05:22,984 --> 00:05:24,400
 Here we
go, this'll help.

60
00:05:24,484 --> 00:05:25,734
 Careful! Ow!

61
00:05:25,817 --> 00:05:26,984
What a thick head!

62
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:28,192
Yeah, ha ha!

63
00:05:28,275 --> 00:05:30,567
He could've been killed!
Shame on you! Hmph!

64
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,942
I thought he was Oolong!

65
00:05:32,025 --> 00:05:34,400
 I was only trying
to protect my daughter.

66
00:05:34,484 --> 00:05:36,400
 Daughter? Does that
mean that you're a girl?

67
00:05:39,775 --> 00:05:42,942
Yep! Thought so!
You're a girl alright.

68
00:05:45,984 --> 00:05:47,609
What'd you do that for?!

69
00:05:47,692 --> 00:05:49,067
Guess, Einstein!

70
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,067
 Hm?

71
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,567
So what does this
Oolong fellow do

72
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,150
that makes everybody
so afraid of him?

73
00:05:56,692 --> 00:05:58,359
He's our worst nightmare.

74
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,859
He's a blackness that has
descended on our village.

75
00:06:00,942 --> 00:06:03,609
A monster who treats
us like his toys.

76
00:06:03,692 --> 00:06:04,734
That bad?

77
00:06:04,817 --> 00:06:05,900
 Much worse.

78
00:06:05,984 --> 00:06:07,275
How so?

79
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,609
Well, somehow this terrible
creature has the power

80
00:06:09,692 --> 00:06:12,734
to change into any
shape it wants to.

81
00:06:20,984 --> 00:06:24,025
Instead of one nightmare,
we're cursed by many.

82
00:06:24,109 --> 00:06:26,609
No one knows his real
identity, we just know

83
00:06:26,692 --> 00:06:28,192
 he wants our daughters.

84
00:06:28,275 --> 00:06:31,359
That monster's kidnapped three
girls from the village already.

85
00:06:31,442 --> 00:06:32,609
 Huh?

86
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:35,192
 And yesterday my
darkest fears came true.

87
00:06:35,275 --> 00:06:38,275
He wants my daughter, Pocowatha.

88
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:40,359
Today's your lucky day,
Sherman Priest!

89
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,109
I've decided to
honor your house by taking

90
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:44,359
your daughter's hand
in marriage tomorrow!

91
00:06:46,525 --> 00:06:47,817
 Pack your
bag, Pocowatha!

92
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,734
And don't worry
about the dowry, Dad!

93
00:06:53,317 --> 00:06:54,442
Bully! Maybe we can

94
00:06:54,525 --> 00:06:56,400
trap him when
he comes back again.

95
00:06:56,484 --> 00:06:58,942
How will you do that?
He's bigger than this house!

96
00:06:59,025 --> 00:07:01,109
My word. You don't
get it, do you?

97
00:07:01,192 --> 00:07:03,317
Oolong would squish
you like a little bug!

98
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,484
There's no way to
stop this monster!

99
00:07:07,067 --> 00:07:09,150
 So tell us: why have
you two come here anyway?

100
00:07:09,234 --> 00:07:10,150
I'll show you.

101
00:07:10,234 --> 00:07:11,609
 Hmm?

102
00:07:12,734 --> 00:07:15,817
 Let's see...
there it is!

103
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,734
We came to find a ball
that matches this one.

104
00:07:18,817 --> 00:07:23,275
Hm. Strange.
Yes, it's very beautiful.

105
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,900
But I've never seen
anything like it.

106
00:07:24,984 --> 00:07:27,734
-- Well, I have.
-- Huh?

107
00:07:27,817 --> 00:07:30,109
Young lady, I have
the matching one.

108
00:07:30,192 --> 00:07:31,817
I knew there was one here!

109
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,609
What do you know?
How 'bout that.

110
00:07:33,692 --> 00:07:35,192
 Can I see it, please?

111
00:07:35,275 --> 00:07:37,484
 Mm-hmm.

112
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:39,025
Here it is.

113
00:07:39,109 --> 00:07:41,359
Yeah! The six-star ball!

114
00:07:41,442 --> 00:07:42,359
 Wow.

115
00:07:42,442 --> 00:07:44,109
--Cool!
--Would you give it to us?

116
00:07:44,192 --> 00:07:45,900
I'm not going to
give this ball away.

117
00:07:45,984 --> 00:07:48,775
It's been in my
family for generations.

118
00:07:50,109 --> 00:07:52,317
 Would you give us
your Dragon Ball if we could

119
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,942
get rid of that Oolong creep,
get the girls back,

120
00:07:55,025 --> 00:07:57,609
and return your village
to a peaceful place again?

121
00:07:57,692 --> 00:08:01,067
 A-Ah, by yourselves?

122
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:04,400
Now, listen, I may be old
but I'm not gullible.

123
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,275
How could the two
of you defeat Oolong?

124
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:09,692
Well, Goku and I
are quite a team, ma'am.

125
00:08:09,775 --> 00:08:10,734
Right? Huh?

126
00:08:15,025 --> 00:08:16,734
So you're a girl,
aren't you?

127
00:08:16,817 --> 00:08:19,025
Huh?! What a randy boy!

128
00:08:19,942 --> 00:08:22,775
Are you crazy?!
Please stop doing that!

129
00:08:22,859 --> 00:08:24,359
 Ugh!

130
00:08:24,442 --> 00:08:26,734
 Do you think that you and
that boy really have a chance

131
00:08:26,817 --> 00:08:28,609
to beat Oolong, Miss?

132
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,900
 Yeah, I think we
have a good chance.

133
00:08:30,984 --> 00:08:33,150
Goku's a little on the puny
side, but he packs a wallop.

134
00:08:33,234 --> 00:08:34,442
Don'tcha kid?

135
00:08:34,525 --> 00:08:35,775
 Hmm.

136
00:08:35,859 --> 00:08:38,359
 I'm Bulma. I'm
the brains of the outfit.

137
00:08:38,442 --> 00:08:39,942
Would you forgive me
for hitting you?

138
00:08:40,025 --> 00:08:41,150
We'd appreciate your help.

139
00:08:41,234 --> 00:08:42,234
 Sure.

140
00:08:42,317 --> 00:08:43,859
There's a legend
that speaks of a boy who

141
00:08:43,942 --> 00:08:45,442
would come to
liberate our people,

142
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,942
but we always thought
it was just folklore.

143
00:08:48,025 --> 00:08:49,192
 Mm-hmm.

144
00:08:49,275 --> 00:08:51,484
Bulma, it would be the
answer to all my prayers

145
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:53,734
if you brought my baby back!

146
00:08:54,525 --> 00:08:56,234
 You have my
blessing young warrior.

147
00:08:56,317 --> 00:08:59,067
Your courage stands like a
great monument before my people.

148
00:09:00,442 --> 00:09:02,400
I just thought of a
great way to trap Oolong.

149
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:05,650
 All right!
You look great, kid!

150
00:09:05,734 --> 00:09:08,484
You'd be totally charming
if you smiled a bit more.

151
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:10,442
There's not much
to smile about.

152
00:09:10,525 --> 00:09:12,484
Can we come up with
a different plan, Bulma?

153
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:14,567
Sorry, no time, kid!

154
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:17,192
Gosh, Goku.
You make a real pretty girl.

155
00:09:17,275 --> 00:09:19,775
 Now remember Goku,
don't blow your cover.

156
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,817
He has to think
you're Pocowatha.

157
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,192
The important thing is
to find out where

158
00:09:23,275 --> 00:09:25,734
he's keeping the girls.
After that you can handle it

159
00:09:25,817 --> 00:09:27,234
any way you want to.

160
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,067
All right, all right.
I'll do it.

161
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,234
But I'm not going to
like this one little bit!

162
00:09:32,984 --> 00:09:33,942
Huh?

163
00:09:34,025 --> 00:09:35,650
 It's Oolong!
He's coming!

164
00:09:52,109 --> 00:09:53,359
 He's coming!

165
00:09:53,442 --> 00:09:56,025
Oolong's in the village
and he's on his way here!

166
00:09:56,109 --> 00:09:58,234
 Good job! Now try
to make sure everyone

167
00:09:58,317 --> 00:09:59,650
gets into their
houses safely!

168
00:09:59,734 --> 00:10:00,692
 I'll do it!

169
00:10:01,525 --> 00:10:03,734
Okay, it's up to you.
Good luck.

170
00:10:03,817 --> 00:10:06,067
Well, since you're
the brains of this outfit,

171
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,942
you're going to help me, right?

172
00:10:11,442 --> 00:10:13,109
 I'll be right here
rooting for you, Goku.

173
00:10:13,192 --> 00:10:14,400
 Mmm.

174
00:10:14,484 --> 00:10:16,317
 Alright, kid,
it's showtime.

175
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,150
Don't let him get a
good look at your face.

176
00:10:18,234 --> 00:10:20,109
And remember: smile.

177
00:10:20,192 --> 00:10:21,984
 Next time, I'm
making the plan.

178
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:27,984
 I've come for
you, my little buttercup!

179
00:10:28,067 --> 00:10:30,067
I brought you some flowers.

180
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,609
I hope you
like them, sweetheart.

181
00:10:32,692 --> 00:10:34,984
 Oh, y-yeah, uh,
I love flowers.

182
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:38,900
 Huh? Packed
your rolling pin?

183
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:42,359
 And I see you've
put on a little weight!

184
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:45,025
 Yeah, well, uh,
l-look who's talking.

185
00:10:45,109 --> 00:10:46,275
You scamp!

186
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:48,900
 A little feisty
today, aren't we?

187
00:10:48,984 --> 00:10:50,942
Goku! Where did you
learn how to act?!

188
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,067
If you don't shape up,
you're gonna

189
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,942
blow this thing big-time!

190
00:10:54,025 --> 00:10:55,484
Mmm.

191
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:57,734
That's good,
I like 'em fiesty.

192
00:10:57,817 --> 00:10:59,317
I wouldn't change
anything on you,

193
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,150
except maybe that ugly scarf.

194
00:11:02,234 --> 00:11:04,109
 Hm? Uh-oh...

195
00:11:04,192 --> 00:11:06,525
Oh my. You're trembling.

196
00:11:06,609 --> 00:11:09,317
 That's because I need
to use the bathroom real bad.

197
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,817
You're scared!

198
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,317
Well, I get my feelings hurt
when girls are scared of me.

199
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,609
 No more! That's it!

200
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:37,067
 Huh?

201
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,359
What do you think of this?

202
00:11:38,442 --> 00:11:40,775
Suave, debonair, handsome.
If you don't like it

203
00:11:40,859 --> 00:11:43,317
I can always change
into something else.

204
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,234
 Aah!

205
00:11:46,317 --> 00:11:48,609
-- Hmm?
-- Huh?

206
00:11:51,025 --> 00:11:53,984
Well, hello there, stranger!
My name's Bulma.

207
00:11:54,067 --> 00:11:56,025
I don't think we've met.

208
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,442
 Aah!

209
00:11:57,525 --> 00:11:59,275
My. Can such beauty be real?

210
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,275
You must be a dream.

211
00:12:01,859 --> 00:12:04,650
Nope, I'm all... woman.

212
00:12:04,734 --> 00:12:07,525
 Imagine, if I had
a woman like that...

213
00:12:07,609 --> 00:12:10,567
Oohhh...

214
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:14,525
Yes. She's a delicious
catch if I ever saw one.

215
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:17,317
Oh, but what about Pocowatha?

216
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,609
So, uh, when are
you gonna kidnap me

217
00:12:18,692 --> 00:12:20,275
and take me away?

218
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:22,317
 Ooh, I can't
just leave Pocowatha,

219
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,775
but I'd be crazy to
refuse a girl like that.

220
00:12:26,692 --> 00:12:30,400
Pocowatha or the new girl?
Pocowatha or the new girl?

221
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:32,442
Pocowatha or the--huh?

222
00:12:33,984 --> 00:12:34,942
Where'd she go?

223
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:43,109
 What?! Am I seeing
what I think I'm seeing?!

224
00:12:43,192 --> 00:12:46,734
This must be some
mistake! It can't be!

225
00:12:46,817 --> 00:12:48,817
Hmm? Uurgh!

226
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,567
I've been deceived!
You're not Pocowatha!

227
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:02,484
Huh? What gave me away?
It was my tail, wasn't it?

228
00:13:02,567 --> 00:13:05,650
If there is one thing
I cannot tolerate,

229
00:13:05,734 --> 00:13:08,859
it is deception!

230
00:13:11,109 --> 00:13:12,484
 Huh?

231
00:13:18,734 --> 00:13:20,317
 Man, that's one big cow!

232
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,525
I'm am not a cow,
I am a bull!

233
00:13:22,609 --> 00:13:23,984
Can't you tell the difference?!

234
00:13:24,067 --> 00:13:25,775
And I'm a pretty mean one, too!

235
00:13:25,859 --> 00:13:27,109
Huh? Whoa!

236
00:13:27,192 --> 00:13:29,025
What happened to my polite,
handsome, debonair man

237
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:30,900
with the really
expensive trench coat?

238
00:13:32,109 --> 00:13:33,067
Excuse me.

239
00:13:33,692 --> 00:13:35,525
This is just too weird!

240
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:39,859
That monstrous beast
has deceived you, too.

241
00:13:39,942 --> 00:13:41,984
He fools you by changing
into the one thing

242
00:13:42,067 --> 00:13:44,484
that you want most. And in
your case, that's a man.

243
00:13:44,567 --> 00:13:46,775
You should be
ashamed of yourself!

244
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,109
Uh...

245
00:13:48,192 --> 00:13:50,192
The good thing is I don't
think he wants to marry

246
00:13:50,275 --> 00:13:53,400
Pocowatha any more, he
wants to marry you instead.

247
00:13:53,484 --> 00:13:55,484
You'll make a
nice bride, Bulma.

248
00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:57,525
What kind of a girl
do you think I am?!

249
00:13:57,609 --> 00:13:59,150
I'm not getting
married to a bull!

250
00:13:59,234 --> 00:14:00,692
And that's that!

251
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,275
Goku, the plan's off, kiddo!

252
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,567
It's time to take
the bull by the horns!

253
00:14:11,275 --> 00:14:12,609
Ha!

254
00:14:12,692 --> 00:14:15,359
Now we'll see just
how tough you really are.

255
00:14:15,442 --> 00:14:17,442
Don't forget to find out
where the girls are!

256
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:19,109
And stay alive, okay?!

257
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:22,109
Say your prayers, chico,
your time has come!

258
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,400
You've reached the end of
the road there, muchacho!

259
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,775
Eh. Smile. Pfft.

260
00:14:30,692 --> 00:14:31,984
What are you, loco, kid?!

261
00:14:32,067 --> 00:14:34,942
There's still a way
you can save yourself!

262
00:14:35,025 --> 00:14:35,984
Get the señorita!

263
00:14:38,609 --> 00:14:40,859
Forget it, bully!
Come on, let's go!

264
00:14:40,942 --> 00:14:42,359
 Alright, then!
So be it!

265
00:14:42,442 --> 00:14:46,150
A little monkey-boy burrito
might hit the spot anyway!

266
00:14:46,234 --> 00:14:47,525
Sounds yummy!

267
00:14:47,609 --> 00:14:49,609
Look, you can't scare me
like you've scared

268
00:14:49,692 --> 00:14:51,400
everyone else.
I'm not buying it!

269
00:14:51,484 --> 00:14:52,567
 Haven't you noticed?!

270
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:55,359
You're a little
cucaracha with a stick,

271
00:14:55,442 --> 00:14:57,984
and I am a gigantic bull!

272
00:14:58,067 --> 00:15:00,984
I don't care what you are,
give those girls back now!

273
00:15:04,734 --> 00:15:06,109
Uh...I will be back!

274
00:15:07,442 --> 00:15:08,400
 Huh?

275
00:15:10,234 --> 00:15:12,525
 Hey! Come back
here and fight!

276
00:15:12,609 --> 00:15:13,984
Where are you going?!

277
00:15:16,734 --> 00:15:18,942
 Hey, come back!

278
00:15:27,942 --> 00:15:29,150
 Huh?

279
00:15:32,484 --> 00:15:33,817
Hey, excuse me.

280
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,025
A giant bull just came
barreling through here.

281
00:15:36,109 --> 00:15:37,859
Did you see where it went?

282
00:15:37,942 --> 00:15:39,109
There.

283
00:15:39,192 --> 00:15:40,192
 Ha-ha!

284
00:15:41,734 --> 00:15:45,192
Hi. This is the bonafide one
hundred percent original me.

285
00:15:45,275 --> 00:15:47,442
Believe it or not,
a good-looking guy like myself

286
00:15:47,525 --> 00:15:49,150
has trouble scoring chicks.

287
00:15:49,234 --> 00:15:50,942
That's why I transform.

288
00:15:53,859 --> 00:15:55,817
 The art of
transformation is a very

289
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,609
powerful technique and should
only be used responsibly

290
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:00,442
to solve serious problems.

291
00:16:00,525 --> 00:16:03,567
In my case, I was being
dogged by girls left and right,

292
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:06,317
despite my natural cute
and cuddly appearance.

293
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,067
But now that I've gone to
shape-shifting school,

294
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,650
all that's changed.

295
00:16:09,734 --> 00:16:12,359
But the problem is I can only
hold a shape for five minutes,

296
00:16:12,442 --> 00:16:13,567
and then, poof!

297
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,275
That's why I had to
run away from that kid.

298
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,609
You say Oolong ran away?

299
00:16:16,692 --> 00:16:17,775
Yeah, I saw him take off,

300
00:16:17,859 --> 00:16:19,900
and Goku went after him.

301
00:16:19,984 --> 00:16:22,234
 Hmm. Remarkable.

302
00:16:22,317 --> 00:16:24,650
What an extraordinary boy.

303
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,400
Yeah. Goku will
chase him a hundred miles

304
00:16:26,484 --> 00:16:27,817
if he has to.

305
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,817
Wow. Maybe it's
the legend after all.

306
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,317
Hey, yo, Oolong.

307
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,067
I know you're out there,
you can't hide forever.

308
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,275
Couldn't find him, huh?

309
00:16:36,359 --> 00:16:38,025
 Uh-uh.

310
00:16:40,859 --> 00:16:43,067
 Hey, everybody,
he ran away!

311
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:46,525
He might just be hiding
though, so look out!

312
00:16:46,609 --> 00:16:48,275
 All right,
here we go again.

313
00:16:48,359 --> 00:16:50,734
But I'd better watch it, or this
kid could ruin a good thing.

314
00:16:50,817 --> 00:16:52,692
If I wanna keep these
simpletons in line,

315
00:16:52,775 --> 00:16:56,484
I'd better come up with
something really fierce.

316
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:59,359
Wait, I know
a good one... Yeah.

317
00:17:01,317 --> 00:17:04,025
 Hmm. I guess he is gone.

318
00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:09,275
Uh...!

319
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,442
Looking for me, kid?

320
00:17:11,775 --> 00:17:14,192
Did you really think
I would run away?!

321
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,817
 You seem a
little timid this time.

322
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,150
Well you're lucky, tiny tot,
because I'm feeling generous.

323
00:17:23,234 --> 00:17:25,359
I was going to dunk you
in this hot soup

324
00:17:25,442 --> 00:17:27,109
and eat you like a dumpling,

325
00:17:27,192 --> 00:17:30,359
but if you leave town now,
I will spare you.

326
00:17:30,442 --> 00:17:33,109
I think I'll stay.
So go ahead and eat me...

327
00:17:33,192 --> 00:17:34,400
if you can!

328
00:17:34,484 --> 00:17:36,775
 If I can?!
How dare you--

329
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,359
 Look what
you made me do!

330
00:17:41,442 --> 00:17:42,400
 What are you
talking about?

331
00:17:42,484 --> 00:17:44,275
I didn't make you do anything!

332
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:45,609
Alright, that does it!

333
00:17:45,692 --> 00:17:47,192
Your luck's run out,
little runt!

334
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,734
I was going to
let you go because

335
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,442
you're not like all
the other cowards,

336
00:17:50,525 --> 00:17:53,359
but now I have no
choice but to destroy--

337
00:17:58,109 --> 00:18:01,192
 Johnny, do you
wanna get yourself killed?!

338
00:18:01,275 --> 00:18:03,317
Ah! You know you've
got a real little monster

339
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,942
on your hands there, lady!

340
00:18:06,025 --> 00:18:07,942
 Kids these days...

341
00:18:08,025 --> 00:18:09,525
Now, where were we?

342
00:18:09,609 --> 00:18:11,859
 You were just saying that
you were going to destroy me.

343
00:18:11,942 --> 00:18:14,234
 Oh, yeah,
yeah, right! Thanks, kid!

344
00:18:14,317 --> 00:18:15,567
You know what though?

345
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,192
I don't think you're as
strong as you say you are.

346
00:18:17,275 --> 00:18:18,567
 Rrrrgh!
Listen here:

347
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,900
I'm the fiercest,
most impolite warrior

348
00:18:20,984 --> 00:18:22,484
on the face of the Earth!

349
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:24,234
 Yeah? I doubt it.

350
00:18:24,317 --> 00:18:25,734
 What makes
you think that you're

351
00:18:25,817 --> 00:18:27,525
any match for me?!

352
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:30,859
I learned karate
from my Grandpa.

353
00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:33,442
 Karate, huh?! Well,
if you're any good at karate,

354
00:18:33,525 --> 00:18:36,317
you could break these
bricks with one hand!

355
00:18:37,442 --> 00:18:38,942
 Oh yeah?
Well, I can break them apart

356
00:18:39,025 --> 00:18:40,984
with one finger! Watch this!

357
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:44,650
 Huh?!

358
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,067
 Do you know
what I do to people

359
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,525
who can do that?!

360
00:18:52,442 --> 00:18:54,609
Nothing! Later, sucker!

361
00:18:54,692 --> 00:18:56,109
Hey, where're ya going?!

362
00:18:56,192 --> 00:18:58,567
Hey, don't just stand there!
Go after him, kid!

363
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:01,525
If he gets away, we'll never
find out where the girls are!

364
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:04,192
Oh, you're right.
Hmm. Nimbus!

365
00:19:09,442 --> 00:19:10,400
Good luck!

366
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:11,734
Amazing!

367
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,400
It's our legend that an
evil monster would be--

368
00:19:13,484 --> 00:19:15,400
toppled over
by a mere boy

369
00:19:15,484 --> 00:19:17,442
who could dance
on the clouds.

370
00:19:21,109 --> 00:19:23,192
That kid was a
royal pain in the kiester!

371
00:19:23,275 --> 00:19:24,525
Too bad he doesn't
know how to fly!

372
00:19:26,859 --> 00:19:27,692
 Hey, Oolong!

373
00:19:29,275 --> 00:19:31,234
Where do you think
you're going?!

374
00:19:34,484 --> 00:19:35,817
 So long, sucker!

375
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,275
 Oh, no you don't!

376
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,275
 Here I come!

377
00:19:55,525 --> 00:19:57,900
 I'm gaining
on you, Oolong!

378
00:20:05,192 --> 00:20:07,567
 I won't let you
get away, you know.

379
00:20:09,234 --> 00:20:11,067
 Oh no!
My five minutes...

380
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,150
are up!

381
00:20:22,025 --> 00:20:23,984
 I'm not ready to die!

382
00:20:24,317 --> 00:20:26,192
That's because you
haven't been being good.

383
00:20:26,275 --> 00:20:28,650
And who the heck
are you? My psychiatrist?!

384
00:20:29,525 --> 00:20:30,692
Well, now, porky,

385
00:20:30,775 --> 00:20:32,484
what do you have to
say for yourself?

386
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:34,567
An apology
would be nice.

387
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,317
All right, then! I'm sorry.

388
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,400
I can't believe I's
scared of that pig...

389
00:20:38,484 --> 00:20:39,900
Now where's my grandaughter

390
00:20:39,984 --> 00:20:41,317
and the rest of the girls?

391
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,442
They're... home.

392
00:20:43,525 --> 00:20:44,275
What home?!

393
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:45,692
Look, pal.

394
00:20:45,775 --> 00:20:48,650
Your reign of terror is over,
capiche?! Now tell us!

395
00:20:48,734 --> 00:20:52,317
Bulma, you're really brave
now that Oolong's tied up.

396
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,817
♪ Doot doo-doo... ♪

397
00:20:53,900 --> 00:21:04,650
♪

398
00:21:04,734 --> 00:21:06,900
Hey! If you're planning on
turning into a bug,

399
00:21:06,984 --> 00:21:09,025
forget it! I'll squash ya!

400
00:21:12,192 --> 00:21:14,275
Where exactly is
this shack of yours?

401
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:15,734
Is it far?

402
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:17,942
Here's my little shack.

403
00:21:23,317 --> 00:21:24,567
Awesome!

404
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,692
You don't see houses like
that every day, do you?

405
00:21:26,775 --> 00:21:28,275
What a palace!

406
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:30,234
 How'd you get
such a big place?

407
00:21:30,317 --> 00:21:31,650
Well, it wasn't easy, kiddo.

408
00:21:31,734 --> 00:21:34,025
I had to rip off
a lot of people.

409
00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:35,150
And you're proud of that?

410
00:21:35,234 --> 00:21:36,942
 Little Flower, it's me!

411
00:21:37,025 --> 00:21:38,442
Your Poo-Paw is here!

412
00:21:38,525 --> 00:21:39,442
 Alexi!

413
00:21:39,525 --> 00:21:40,484
 Mother's here, Sarah!

414
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:41,775
 You're safe now,
sweetheart!

415
00:21:41,859 --> 00:21:44,109
Don't worry, girls!
We're coming!

416
00:21:46,484 --> 00:21:48,067
 Huh?! Sarah!
Is that you?!

417
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,400
 Alexi!
What are you doing?!

418
00:21:50,484 --> 00:21:54,317
Oh, hi, Daddy.
What's happening?

419
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,942
Sorry, I didn't write, Mommy.
I've been super busy.

420
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:59,984
Me, too. Man, time has
just been flying by.

421
00:22:00,067 --> 00:22:01,442
 Did you find them?

422
00:22:01,525 --> 00:22:02,900
-- Huh?
-- Hi, girls.

423
00:22:02,984 --> 00:22:05,067
 Oh, hi snookums!
Oh, before I forget,

424
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,775
I'm totally out of pink
lipstick and red nail polish.

425
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:09,442
 And I need
a new hair-dryer.

426
00:22:09,525 --> 00:22:11,859
 Did you bring
the diet drinks I asked you for?

427
00:22:11,942 --> 00:22:13,442
I was hoping
these girls would cook

428
00:22:13,525 --> 00:22:15,109
and take care of my house,
but they won't.

429
00:22:15,192 --> 00:22:16,984
All they wanna do
is lay around.

430
00:22:17,067 --> 00:22:19,067
Take them off my hands.
Pretty please?

431
00:22:23,025 --> 00:22:25,150
Well, this belongs
to you and Goku now.

432
00:22:25,234 --> 00:22:27,192
Wow, you made our day!

433
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:32,192
 Just two more to go and
then I can call the Dragon

434
00:22:32,275 --> 00:22:34,067
to make my wish!
