1
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,834
 Boy, this
place is really strange.

2
00:02:17,917 --> 00:02:19,167
 Isn't there
supposed to be a town

3
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,084
around here somewhere, Oolong?

4
00:02:21,167 --> 00:02:23,000
I don't know.
I've never been in this

5
00:02:23,084 --> 00:02:24,750
neck of the woods before!

6
00:02:27,042 --> 00:02:30,834
Oh no! We're
just about on empty, guys!

7
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:34,209
 Oh great! We should've
filled up at that last town!

8
00:02:34,292 --> 00:02:36,417
 We were going
to, but some 'dumb bunny'

9
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,084
insisted we were almost there.

10
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:40,584
Hey, don't blame me!

11
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,792
Watch it!
I'm trying to drive!

12
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,542
 You're not
trying hard enough!

13
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:49,334
Hey! What are you doing?
Keep your eyes on the road!

14
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:51,959
 Great! Just what
I need, a backseat driver!

15
00:02:52,042 --> 00:02:53,417
 At least I
know how to drive!

16
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,625
 Yeah!
You're driving me crazy!

17
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:56,709
 Look out!

18
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,875
 Ha ha! That was fun!

19
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,125
 Fun? I
could've been killed!

20
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:07,542
Ha! Hear that?

21
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:10,209
What a bunch of clowns, huh?
They're gonna lead us right to

22
00:03:10,292 --> 00:03:11,709
that last Dragon Ball!

23
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:12,834
Yeah!

24
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:14,042
 Keep your
hands on the wheel!

25
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,459
 Keep your
hands on your mouth!

26
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:17,250
 You were
picking your snout again!

27
00:03:17,334 --> 00:03:19,334
What a pretty voice.

28
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:25,542
Did I say pretty
voice? I, uh meant to say

29
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:26,959
she has a pretty face.

30
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:29,375
No, no, I mean, I said she
has a pretty--No, I didn't

31
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:34,125
mean to say pretty at all.
I don't know what I meant.

32
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:38,917
 Here! I think you
need to cool off, Yamcha.

33
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,875
That hit the spot!

34
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:50,834
 Was not!

35
00:03:50,917 --> 00:03:51,917
 I saw you!

36
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,375
 Was not!

37
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:15,917
See, I was right after all,
Oolong!

38
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,167
"See, I was right after all."

39
00:04:25,042 --> 00:04:25,917
 Hello there!

40
00:04:29,917 --> 00:04:31,500
Golly!

41
00:04:33,584 --> 00:04:35,084
 That's the way
it happens sometimes, kid.

42
00:04:35,417 --> 00:04:37,125
 Maybe for you it does.

43
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:38,084
 Who asked you?

44
00:04:38,834 --> 00:04:40,167
Hello, can I--

45
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:42,959
 Fill her up, please.

46
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:50,459
 Hey, Bulma!

47
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:53,209
These people all seem
scared of you for some reason.

48
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:56,500
 It's not every day they
get to see a beautiful stranger.

49
00:04:56,584 --> 00:04:57,959
 Ha, I'm going shopping!

50
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:02,417
I wonder if they sell
Dyno Caps in this town.

51
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,000
 Goku was right.

52
00:05:09,084 --> 00:05:11,625
 These people here
really are scared of me.

53
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:13,125
Creepy!

54
00:05:14,917 --> 00:05:16,917
 Ah-ha! Here
we go! Dyno Caps!

55
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,084
There you go,
it's full to the brim!

56
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:24,375
Can you wait just a minute?
Our friend's gonna be

57
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:26,625
right back with some cash.

58
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:29,125
Oh no, no, no,
that's okay!

59
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:31,292
It is on my house!

60
00:05:38,334 --> 00:05:40,167
 You certainly
have a wide selection here.

61
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,750
Well, do you
have any XB6's?

62
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:46,542
Yes, and sevens.

63
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:50,000
Alright then... I'll
take two of those there...

64
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:51,917
 And three XB7's please.

65
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,459
 Yes, whatever
you wish. Here you are,

66
00:05:53,542 --> 00:05:54,917
please take them!

67
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,084
Well, I guess that's
all I'll be needing today.

68
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:58,667
So, how much?

69
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,750
No! Nothing!
Please, just take them!

70
00:06:01,834 --> 00:06:03,209
Oh?

71
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:09,084
Talk about a bargain!
There are some expensive

72
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:12,334
Dyno Caps, and I managed
to get them all for free!

73
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:14,542
You know, I sure am glad
some people know how to

74
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,667
treat a beautiful
stranger like me!

75
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:28,125
 It sure is taking
them a long time to get gas!

76
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:42,667
 Bah! This
town is so boring.

77
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,000
 Why don't
we stir things up around here?

78
00:06:45,084 --> 00:06:46,500
 Sounds good to me.

79
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:52,375
 Here!
That's a good look for you.

80
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:12,709
What? You mean
you're not a member of

81
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:14,792
the Rabbits, young lady?

82
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,625
The Rabbits?
What's that?

83
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:19,459
 Get out of here!

84
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:20,584
--Man!
--And stay out!

85
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:22,959
How dare you play
such a dirty trick?!

86
00:07:26,834 --> 00:07:29,500
Now, for some reason,
nobody's even looking at me.

87
00:07:29,584 --> 00:07:31,917
And they're definitely
don't look scared anymore.

88
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,750
Hey, Puar,
here comes that girl.

89
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,000
Hey guys! I got
some really great stuff here.

90
00:07:43,084 --> 00:07:44,209
 I hope you
got some food in there.

91
00:07:44,292 --> 00:07:45,792
I'm starving!

92
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,750
 Food? Are you kiddin'?
Those bags are full of make-up

93
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:49,209
and clothes, buddy.

94
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:56,167
 Yuck! These
apples are rotten!

95
00:07:58,334 --> 00:08:00,042
Hey!
We've been ripped off!

96
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,209
You heard him!
We want our money back!

97
00:08:02,292 --> 00:08:03,917
But you got them free!

98
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,667
 You
don't hear so good!

99
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,209
He said we want our money back!

100
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:10,792
 Here, here!
Please, forgive!

101
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,375
 Mama!

102
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:20,000
 Hey! Don't you
know that no one's supposed

103
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:22,250
to cross the path of a Rabbit?!

104
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:24,500
Yes! I'm sorry,
but he's just a boy,

105
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:26,792
he doesn't know any better!

106
00:08:29,084 --> 00:08:30,750
 Here's a
lesson he'll remember!

107
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:35,459
Holy cow!
These goons are serious!

108
00:08:35,542 --> 00:08:37,750
So they're the Rabbits!

109
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:43,625
Look, buddy.
There's a new chick in town!

110
00:08:47,334 --> 00:08:49,542
 How do
you like them apples?

111
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:53,292
 My, my, my.

112
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,584
Hey there, pretty lady, how'd
you like to spend some time

113
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:58,709
with a couple of real
men? Yes, maybe?

114
00:08:58,792 --> 00:09:00,834
Why? Have you seen any?

115
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:03,709
You must be new in town
if you're dumb enough to

116
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:05,917
talk to the Rabbits like that!

117
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,084
 Maybe we should
teach her some manners?

118
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:10,667
 If anyone has
anything to learn, it's you

119
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,834
two Cro-Magnon morons!

120
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:14,542
 Grown
men in rabbit ears!

121
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:17,875
Ha! Can you believe
these two idiots?

122
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:21,959
 Come on, you
guys. We're leaving.

123
00:09:22,042 --> 00:09:23,709
 Hold it.

124
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,292
What's the big hurry, toots?
The party's just starting!

125
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,542
 Yes, maybe.

126
00:09:34,542 --> 00:09:37,125
Goku, these bad men
need to be taken care of

127
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:39,584
or they might hurt us.

128
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:41,709
Oh, okay.

129
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:45,250
Wait!
Goku's no match for a pistol!

130
00:09:46,292 --> 00:09:48,625
Yeah!
He's gonna "take care" of us.

131
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:51,625
Frightening, isn't he?
Little pipsqueak.

132
00:09:59,084 --> 00:10:01,917
 Oh my, I hope
he doesn't hurt us too bad!

133
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,375
 Yeah!

134
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:05,792
 What the--?

135
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:19,209
 One down and one to go!

136
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:21,542
Hey, kid!

137
00:10:41,042 --> 00:10:42,500
I don't think
those guys are gonna

138
00:10:42,584 --> 00:10:44,709
hurt anyone now, Bulma.

139
00:10:44,792 --> 00:10:46,959
You're right!
Thanks to you!

140
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:49,792
 Hmph! I
coulda done that.

141
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,375
Ha!

142
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:53,875
Those guys didn't know what they
were getting themselves into.

143
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,500
Now you've done it!
You've insulted the Rabbits,

144
00:11:01,584 --> 00:11:04,584
and you're gonna pay
big time for this, kid!

145
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:06,584
No, he didn't
insult the Rabbits.

146
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,792
He just beat them up!

147
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,625
Boss, this is Rabbit One!

148
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:13,250
Come to town, pronto!

149
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,750
We got ourselves a
troublemaker down here.

150
00:11:22,459 --> 00:11:25,042
A curse on you! Thanks
to you, the boss is coming!

151
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:43,709
 Whoa?

152
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:45,584
 I got a nose
for trouble, guys, and this

153
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:48,792
place stinks! I tell ya
something bad is gonna happen!

154
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,459
I knew we never
should have stopped here.

155
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:52,334
I wanted to keep going!

156
00:11:52,417 --> 00:11:55,500
 Oolong, you did not! We
came here for gas, remember?!

157
00:11:55,584 --> 00:11:57,542
 Fine, we
got our gas, let's go!

158
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,459
Well, nothing's happening.

159
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,459
 Listen, I
say we get out of here

160
00:12:45,542 --> 00:12:46,917
before something does happen.

161
00:12:49,042 --> 00:12:52,042
Well, I'm not going to let
a couple of goons wearing

162
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,917
rabbit ears scare me away!

163
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,959
Hey, get up!
You're okay.

164
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:59,292
 Oh, but it hurts...

165
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,625
 Don't worry. The
boss is coming, and he'll do

166
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:04,000
his special thing
to those intruders!

167
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:06,834
"Special thing"?

168
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,542
Hey, what's this
"special thing"?

169
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,084
 Just a little trick
our boss does to entertain.

170
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:14,875
So stick around
and enjoy the show.

171
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,584
 Don't worry,
he's not going to turn

172
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:19,500
you into a carrot, or anything!

173
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:23,875
I don't like carrots.

174
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,042
Hey!
Let's get out of here, Goku!

175
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,042
I wanna stay and see
what everyone around here

176
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,750
is so scared of.

177
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,042
Yeah, me too.

178
00:13:49,167 --> 00:13:52,250
 Here comes the
boss! Hey, boss over here!

179
00:13:52,334 --> 00:13:54,792
 Are my ears
on straight? Yes, yes, maybe.

180
00:14:11,292 --> 00:14:13,750
 Whoa! Looks like
the circus has come to town!

181
00:14:13,834 --> 00:14:16,042
Oh, Boss, help us!

182
00:14:17,042 --> 00:14:18,542
Knock it off, you mugs!

183
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,750
Just point me out the sap that
thinks he's tough enough to take

184
00:14:20,834 --> 00:14:22,292
on the mighty Rabbits!

185
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,750
That's him, over there!

186
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,917
 You mean that
old furball is their leader?

187
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,459
 Yeah, look
at him! He looks like a

188
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:30,334
reject from an Easter parade!

189
00:14:30,417 --> 00:14:32,209
 We heard that, pig!

190
00:14:32,292 --> 00:14:33,875
 Oh yeah?
What are you gonna do?

191
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,417
Wiggle your nose and tickle me?!

192
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,292
 Awfully big
words for a bacon bit!

193
00:14:41,042 --> 00:14:42,959
 Good one!

194
00:14:43,334 --> 00:14:45,542
I know I've seen
that rabbit before...

195
00:14:46,792 --> 00:14:48,209
 You call
yourself "Rabbits" and

196
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:50,209
you got beaten up by a kid?

197
00:14:50,292 --> 00:14:51,917
Uh, sorry Boss...

198
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,417
 Quit groveling!

199
00:14:53,834 --> 00:14:54,917
Watch this!

200
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,292
 Let's
shake hands, baby!

201
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,250
I wouldn't trust him, Bulma.

202
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:11,792
Hey, did you want
to be friends with us?

203
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,834
 Certainly!

204
00:15:13,917 --> 00:15:16,834
Now I remember!
His touch is his weapon!

205
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:19,584
If they shake his hand
they're goners for sure!

206
00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:23,334
There! Now make
like a nice bunny and

207
00:15:23,417 --> 00:15:25,292
hop out of here, would ya?

208
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:29,792
You touched me!

209
00:15:35,292 --> 00:15:38,375
 You turned
Bulma into a carrot!

210
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:39,917
Want a bite, maybe?

211
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:43,417
 Serves you right
for messin' with da boss!

212
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:48,209
His name is Monster Carrot,
and his touch is lethal!

213
00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:50,125
 You bully!

214
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,917
Change her back!

215
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:55,959
Sure, kid, if you want to end

216
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:58,709
up like your friend. Why
don't you come and get me?

217
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,125
 But you gotta
like vegetables, 'cause if you

218
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:04,084
touch me, you're gonna be one!

219
00:16:06,084 --> 00:16:08,750
Come on, Goku, use
your Power Pole! That way you

220
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,125
won't have to touch him!

221
00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:11,875
Yeah, that's right! Ha!

222
00:16:18,917 --> 00:16:22,334
 Stop! Don't
forget about your friend here!

223
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:28,959
Kid! You take one more
step and I'll have this

224
00:16:29,042 --> 00:16:31,084
delicious carrot for my lunch!

225
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,459
Alright,
you win! I give up!

226
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:41,334
Oolong!

227
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,709
What do you think
I should do now?

228
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:44,167
 Run for it!

229
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,625
 Man,
that pig is flying!

230
00:16:48,334 --> 00:16:49,750
Oolong,
you're not a pig!

231
00:16:49,834 --> 00:16:51,417
You're a big chicken!

232
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,542
Tough break!
You're on your own, kid!

233
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,417
It's just you and
the Rabbits now!

234
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,875
Boys! Go get 'em!

235
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,459
Sure thing, Boss!

236
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:01,834
Yes!

237
00:17:01,917 --> 00:17:04,667
I'm gonna pound him
flat like a postage stamp!

238
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:17,292
Puar! Come on!
That kid needs our help!

239
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:20,750
It's up to us to get him out
of this mess! Otherwise we'll

240
00:17:20,834 --> 00:17:22,542
never see those Dragon Balls!

241
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,875
 Change into a
bird and snatch that carrot!

242
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:27,334
 Right!

243
00:17:36,084 --> 00:17:37,584
Come on, pick it
up a little, boys.

244
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:39,709
I don't have all day, you know.

245
00:18:09,709 --> 00:18:11,417
We've got the carrot, Goku!

246
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,042
Now you can finish him
off with your Power Pole!

247
00:18:14,417 --> 00:18:15,500
Hey!

248
00:18:15,584 --> 00:18:18,667
You're helping us!
That's real nice of you!

249
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,750
Never mind that!
Get Monster Carrot!

250
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:22,917
Right.

251
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,042
Come back here, thief!

252
00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:29,750
I! Want! My! Carrot!

253
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,250
 Gotcha! Uh-oh!

254
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,125
 Yeah, here she comes!

255
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:38,584
 Ah, I
want that carrot, you dumb bird!

256
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:40,167
Gimme, gimme, gimme!

257
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:43,750
Good work, Puar, now
bring that carrot over here!

258
00:18:43,834 --> 00:18:45,209
And hurry!

259
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,375
 Touch me!

260
00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:58,042
 Ow...

261
00:19:06,792 --> 00:19:08,250
Hey! If we smash
into him, we'll

262
00:19:08,334 --> 00:19:10,000
touch and turn into carrots!

263
00:19:23,834 --> 00:19:26,167
Are you looking for
this, Mister Rabbit?

264
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,917
 Stop! What
about your little friend?!

265
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,875
That's right. You
don't want anything

266
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:45,334
to happen to her, do ya?

267
00:19:52,834 --> 00:19:55,750
 Whoa! Who are
you? Where did you come from?

268
00:19:55,834 --> 00:19:58,167
 Touch me! All
I want is a little touch.

269
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,792
Just one, little touch!

270
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,834
No! Stay back! Stay back!

271
00:20:02,917 --> 00:20:05,209
Goku, time to
use your Power Pole!

272
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,292
 Power Pole! Extend!

273
00:20:20,209 --> 00:20:22,584
Hey! You better change her back!

274
00:20:22,667 --> 00:20:24,334
Or else I'm gonna
whack you again!

275
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,334
Whack me again?

276
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:29,459
Yeah, whack you again.

277
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:33,709
Okay, I guess you win!

278
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:40,792
Bulma!

279
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:43,334
Oh man, I feel
like a vegetable.

280
00:20:43,417 --> 00:20:47,042
You were until Yamcha
and Puar helped us!

281
00:20:47,459 --> 00:20:48,834
Yamcha! Where is he?

282
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,750
I guess he
took off already.

283
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,250
She likes you.

284
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,959
You know, it was a lot
easier for me to be around her

285
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:02,709
when she was just produce!

286
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,167
 Try not
to touch us, boss!

287
00:21:15,459 --> 00:21:16,334
So, Oolong!

288
00:21:16,417 --> 00:21:17,542
Where were you, huh?

289
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,417
Some friend you are,
running away like that!

290
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,334
I, uh, made sure
no one took the car!

291
00:21:23,417 --> 00:21:25,959
Yeah right! You might
as well have coward stamped

292
00:21:26,042 --> 00:21:28,459
on that big forehead of yours!

293
00:21:28,542 --> 00:21:30,584
Boy, you were a
lot nicer when you

294
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:31,542
were a carrot, ya know.

295
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:32,417
 I heard that!

296
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:37,375
That should do it!
Now to finish the job with

297
00:21:37,459 --> 00:21:38,834
my Power Pole!

298
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,584
He's gonna whack us!

299
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:45,250
 Don't worry,
I'm not going to hit you.

300
00:21:48,542 --> 00:21:50,792
Power Pole, extend!

301
00:22:02,292 --> 00:22:04,084
How can we
ever repay you?

302
00:22:04,167 --> 00:22:06,459
Hey, don't sweat it!
This one's on my house!

303
00:22:10,792 --> 00:22:13,000
 So, what did you
do with the Rabbit gang?

304
00:22:13,084 --> 00:22:15,542
I took 'em to the moon!

305
00:22:18,542 --> 00:22:20,542
 I told them that if they
made enough rabbit treats for

306
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:23,625
all the kids on Earth, I might
let them come back down.

307
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,084
It should keep
them busy for awhile.

308
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,792
 Rabbit treats?

309
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:29,292
 What, don't
you like marshmallows?
