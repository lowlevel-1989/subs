1
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,500
 Make a wish!

2
00:01:52,584 --> 00:01:55,084
 Previously on Dragon
Ball, Oolong may have saved the

3
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:58,125
world from Emperor Pilaf,
but now that Goku has caught

4
00:01:58,209 --> 00:02:00,875
a glimpse of the full moon, he
and the rest of the gang have

5
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:03,209
an all new danger to face!

6
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:41,042
He's walking away, you guys!

7
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:42,709
We better make a break for it!

8
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:44,500
This whole place
is gonna be rubble if

9
00:02:44,584 --> 00:02:45,959
he doesn't change back!

10
00:02:52,834 --> 00:02:55,167
I was dreaming I was a bee...

11
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,042
and I was about
to sting someone!

12
00:03:06,292 --> 00:03:08,417
Don't take my honey,
you mean old bear...

13
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,875
Don't take my honey, please!

14
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,667
Emperor, wake up!

15
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:17,417
 Uh, sire!
We've got company!

16
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,334
 Huh?

17
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,625
Don't just sit there,
you fools!

18
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:27,459
Get up there and kill it!

19
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:28,917
Yes, sir...

20
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,709
 Take that you monster!

21
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:32,042
 Get outta here!

22
00:03:33,584 --> 00:03:34,875
You idiots!

23
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,000
Who taught you how to
scare away monsters anyway?!

24
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:38,084
Watch!

25
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:39,542
Oooh! Ahhh! Boo! Boo!

26
00:03:51,042 --> 00:03:52,167
All right, come on,
let's go!

27
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,625
There's no time to lose!

28
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,542
 Well, then give me
a hand here, you big lummox!

29
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,500
Uh... What?

30
00:03:59,584 --> 00:04:00,500
Do you mean me?

31
00:04:00,584 --> 00:04:01,959
 Who do you think I mean?

32
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,250
Waah!

33
00:04:07,292 --> 00:04:08,500
 Wait up, Mai!

34
00:04:08,584 --> 00:04:09,375
 Hurry, Shu!

35
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:10,834
 I am!

36
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,625
 Come on...

37
00:04:19,917 --> 00:04:20,959
What's wrong with this thing?

38
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:22,250
Why won't it start?!

39
00:04:22,334 --> 00:04:24,500
Maybe because you're
not yelling loud enough?

40
00:04:32,584 --> 00:04:34,542
Come on! Come on! Go! Go!

41
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,292
I'm doing
my best, Emperor!

42
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,834
She's just being stubborn!

43
00:04:50,334 --> 00:04:52,542
It's all over!
We're doomed!

44
00:04:57,084 --> 00:04:58,459
I did it!

45
00:05:06,334 --> 00:05:06,917
 Come on, Mai!

46
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,459
 Faster!

47
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:09,875
 Here we go!

48
00:05:23,209 --> 00:05:24,834
Oh, Bulma! Are you okay?!

49
00:05:24,917 --> 00:05:26,292
What's the matter, kid?

50
00:05:27,542 --> 00:05:29,000
It's my leg!

51
00:05:29,084 --> 00:05:30,459
 Don't worry,
I'll get you!

52
00:05:32,334 --> 00:05:33,250
Hey, Don Juan!

53
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:35,500
Can't you see I
need a hand here?

54
00:05:35,584 --> 00:05:37,917
I-I'm sorry,
I just... can't.

55
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,334
 Come on, Yamcha.

56
00:05:39,417 --> 00:05:40,125
You can do it!

57
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:48,417
What are you
waiting for?!

58
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,375
 Yamcha! Come on!

59
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,250
Oh boy!

60
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,459
I just can't bear to watch
my castle being destroyed

61
00:06:18,542 --> 00:06:20,959
like this! My
insurance premiums

62
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:22,792
are gonna go
through the roof...

63
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:23,834
Turn around!

64
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:24,542
 Huh?!

65
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,459
You heard me! Go back!

66
00:06:26,542 --> 00:06:29,584
We're going to beat that big
monkey even if we have to ram

67
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:30,834
this plane up its nose!

68
00:06:30,917 --> 00:06:32,375
Oh, but, Emperor!

69
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,875
Don't you want
to reconsider, sir?

70
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:36,209
 Where's
the eject button?!

71
00:06:36,292 --> 00:06:37,042
You're getting out!

72
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:37,584
 Sorry, sir!

73
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:39,042
Sorry!

74
00:06:44,084 --> 00:06:47,042
I did it!
I... I did it!

75
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,084
I can't... believe...
I... did it

76
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,167
Well, I can...

77
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:55,875
Thanks for playing my
knight in shining armor...

78
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,709
I can't believe I
actually touched a girl...

79
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:08,167
And I'm still all right!

80
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,042
Die! Die!

81
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:21,834
Goku!

82
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,292
Oh no!

83
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,917
So he's a big hairy ape! That's
no reason to shoot him!

84
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,375
Eat lead, you big baboon!

85
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:04,459
Why, our puny gun
is totally useless!

86
00:08:04,542 --> 00:08:06,584
Now I just think we
made him really mad!

87
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,750
All right then, it's
time we played our trump card...

88
00:08:09,834 --> 00:08:12,417
Fire the heat-seeking missile!

89
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,875
Right!

90
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:17,834
 Easy, big boy...

91
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:19,000
That's it!

92
00:08:19,084 --> 00:08:19,667
Locked on target...

93
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,125
Firing!

94
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:23,542
Oh no!

95
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:27,792
 Bulls-eye!

96
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:46,792
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

97
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,667
I did it! It worked!
I killed him!

98
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,834
Is... Is Goku dead?

99
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:57,959
Oh, Goku...

100
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:14,000
 Like I always say: 'The
bigger they are, the harder they

101
00:09:14,084 --> 00:09:17,250
fall'! That'll teach
him not to monkey with me!

102
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:19,750
Wow, he sure is huge!

103
00:09:19,834 --> 00:09:21,000
and smelly...

104
00:09:21,084 --> 00:09:23,000
More importantly,
why did he have to go and

105
00:09:23,084 --> 00:09:25,417
wreck my castle? Just my luck!

106
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:32,334
It took me ten years
to build that castle...

107
00:09:32,417 --> 00:09:35,959
and now it's gone! Gone!

108
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:41,250
 I hate you,
you... You overgrown ape!

109
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,542
It's gone!
Gone! Gone! Gone!

110
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:50,750
It's moving!

111
00:10:02,042 --> 00:10:03,417
He's alive!

112
00:10:15,042 --> 00:10:17,000
Hurry!
It's coming right for us!

113
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,500
Well at least
my head doesn't hurt...

114
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,250
Wow, that was close...

115
00:10:45,334 --> 00:10:47,292
No kidding! Too close!

116
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:50,667
And it doesn't look
like Goku's finished yet!

117
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,375
I guess we'd better
hide out 'til morning

118
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:57,667
when the moon goes down...

119
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,209
Uhh, let's go that way!

120
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:01,417
 Yeah...

121
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,375
 Hey!

122
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:07,959
Aren't you guys
forgetting something...?

123
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,250
Bulma! Are you okay?!

124
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,042
 No, it won't budge!

125
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:18,667
Oh no...

126
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,459
Here he comes!

127
00:11:24,542 --> 00:11:25,500
Quick!

128
00:11:30,417 --> 00:11:32,167
 Oh no! Oh no! Oh no!

129
00:11:35,584 --> 00:11:36,584
Thanks, Yamcha!

130
00:11:36,667 --> 00:11:37,334
 No problem!

131
00:11:37,417 --> 00:11:38,250
 Come on!

132
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:43,584
Bulma!

133
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:47,542
 Goku! Look!
It's me! Put me down!

134
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,792
I guess it's up
to me now to save her...

135
00:12:09,334 --> 00:12:11,250
Yamcha, didn't you
say that Goku's weak

136
00:12:11,334 --> 00:12:13,167
point is his tail?

137
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,167
Yeah! That's it, Puar!

138
00:12:19,542 --> 00:12:21,584
 It's time...

139
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:23,042
For my
Wolf Fang Fist!

140
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,000
Hyaah!

141
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:33,167
Ha, ha, ha!

142
00:12:41,292 --> 00:12:42,667
Huh?!

143
00:13:02,334 --> 00:13:05,500
Hold on, Yamcha! We're coming!

144
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,000
 Huh?!

145
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,584
Quick, Puar! Now's our chance!

146
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:19,167
Turn into a giant pair of
scissors and snip off his tail!

147
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:19,625
Right!

148
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,875
 Catch me!

149
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,042
Well he's back to himself!

150
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,625
Uh... Well almost...

151
00:14:07,834 --> 00:14:10,000
 So that little
kid caused all of this?

152
00:14:10,084 --> 00:14:11,625
Why didn't one of
you morons kill him

153
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:13,209
when you had the chance?

154
00:14:13,292 --> 00:14:15,709
 You wanted to
let them bake, sire!

155
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:16,750
 Oh yeah...

156
00:14:16,834 --> 00:14:18,167
But this is
still all your fault!

157
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,125
Is that clear?

158
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:20,292
 Yes, sire...

159
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,834
 My poor castle!

160
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:28,917
My castle!

161
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,000
It's not over yet!

162
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,292
 Here... and here.

163
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:41,417
Now, listen
carefully, you two.

164
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,250
My Great-Granddaddy Pilaf
used to say there's no

165
00:14:44,334 --> 00:14:46,667
sense crying over your
losses until you've gotten

166
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,334
your revenge. So, let's
get our revenge and let

167
00:14:49,417 --> 00:14:51,459
the crying begin!

168
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,750
Wow, what a guy!

169
00:14:53,834 --> 00:14:56,834
Yeah, he must've
been quite an inspiration.

170
00:14:57,542 --> 00:14:58,542
 All right!

171
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,042
Now let's get
those trouble makers!

172
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,084
 Yeah!

173
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:02,542
 Let's do it!

174
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,500
 Huh?!

175
00:15:07,334 --> 00:15:09,042
Hey, Emperor Pilaf!

176
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,084
Where are you going, sire?

177
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:12,917
Never mind me, you fools!

178
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,834
Just get those pesky kids! And
remember the ageless words of

179
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,917
my dear Great-Granddaddy Pilaf!

180
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:24,209
 Wait up!

181
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:52,125
That was quite a
predicament that Goku

182
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:54,125
managed to
get us into, huh?

183
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:56,084
Yeah, but if he hadn't
changed into that monster

184
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:59,167
we would have all been
barbecued in Pilaf's cell!

185
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,292
We'd better not tell
him that he stomped his

186
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:05,042
grandpa to death... It would
just break his little heart.

187
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:08,209
Did you guys know a
terrible monster comes out

188
00:16:08,292 --> 00:16:09,834
when the moon is full?

189
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:11,875
But I'm not
making it up, Bulma!

190
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:15,375
My Grandpa was trampled to
death by that horrible monster.

191
00:16:17,292 --> 00:16:20,917
Oh... It's just
so hard to believe...

192
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,417
So what's the deal?
Is Goku some kind of alien?

193
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,292
He looks normal enough...

194
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,750
I have a feeling he'll
be quite normal now

195
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:31,042
that his tail's been cut off.

196
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,417
 I sure hope so.

197
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,875
I've got enough friends
with weird hang-ups already!

198
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,459
Not mentioning any
names, of course...

199
00:16:39,084 --> 00:16:40,667
Oh boy, he's waking up!

200
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:44,709
Goodness!

201
00:16:45,084 --> 00:16:46,209
Good morning, kid.

202
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:47,500
Hi!

203
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,375
So, feeling light-hearted
this morning, are we?

204
00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:52,834
Yeah!

205
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:55,292
 My-My clothes are gone!

206
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,584
You don't remember
anything, do you, Goku?

207
00:16:57,959 --> 00:16:59,334
Huh?

208
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:00,667
How about
sharing some of your

209
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,959
clothes with Goku, Oolong?

210
00:17:03,042 --> 00:17:04,459
Anything but my
undies, made of the

211
00:17:04,542 --> 00:17:08,000
finest cotton in the universe,
and supremely comfortable!

212
00:17:08,084 --> 00:17:09,459
Oolong!

213
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:13,375
Well, all right then,
he can borrow my pants.

214
00:17:17,334 --> 00:17:18,875
 Check him out!
Now that's a

215
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,500
definite improvement!
That's style!

216
00:17:21,584 --> 00:17:24,084
Your legs are a lot
shorter than mine are.

217
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:26,584
Hey! What's with
the wise-crack, huh?!

218
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:28,292
Uh? W-Wuh--?

219
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,584
Uh, didn't mean to
frighten you there, kid.

220
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:33,459
You didn't.
I just can't seem to stand up!

221
00:17:33,542 --> 00:17:35,459
That's not too surprising.
You probably just

222
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:36,917
need to spend a
little time learning

223
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,709
how to balance
without your tail.

224
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:40,500
Why would I
wanna do that?

225
00:17:40,584 --> 00:17:44,042
Wha--? Oh, no way!

226
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,625
My tail's gone you guys!

227
00:17:46,459 --> 00:17:47,792
 Oh, where
could it have gone?

228
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,000
I can't believe it!

229
00:17:49,084 --> 00:17:50,584
It's really gone you guys!

230
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:52,042
I'm sure it was
there last night!

231
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:55,125
It's just disappeared!
Vanished! I don't know!

232
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,709
Guess I should wait
for it to come back...

233
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,042
You are one strange,
little kid, Goku.

234
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,917
 Where's my...
uh... Power Pole?

235
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,084
Oh, it's that way...
Where the castle used to be.

236
00:18:09,167 --> 00:18:10,667
 It's demolished!

237
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,334
I sure hope... my Power Pole's
still out here!

238
00:18:14,417 --> 00:18:16,375
Wah! Ow...

239
00:18:17,459 --> 00:18:18,709
Wah!

240
00:18:18,792 --> 00:18:20,667
What are we gonna do now?
We can't look for the

241
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:24,084
Dragon Balls for a whole
year, so... I guess we

242
00:18:24,167 --> 00:18:25,750
should just go our
separate ways, huh?

243
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,792
Well, yeah, that seems
like the thing to do.

244
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,750
Hey, it's time to wake up,
my furry, little friend.

245
00:18:33,417 --> 00:18:35,917
 Oh well. I guess it's
going to be a whole year before

246
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,209
I can have my wish
granted for a new boyfriend...

247
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,209
 So, I've got to
spend another year acting like

248
00:18:42,292 --> 00:18:45,334
a lunk-head everytime a
pretty girl comes around...

249
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:47,042
 I'll never
get a girlfriend!

250
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,500
 Hmm!

251
00:18:51,584 --> 00:18:52,959
--Hm?
--Huh?

252
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,625
Ugh!

253
00:18:58,167 --> 00:19:00,250
 Hey Oolong, I found it!

254
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:03,417
Is there something
bugging you, Oolong?

255
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,792
Yeah, get a load of
Tweedle-Dum and Tweedle-Dee!

256
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,709
It looks like
they're hearing music...

257
00:19:14,792 --> 00:19:16,542
Boy, that's sure weird...

258
00:19:17,542 --> 00:19:18,750
Ooh!

259
00:19:18,834 --> 00:19:21,875
Uh! Oh no! Did I hurt you,
Bulma? Let me see...

260
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:24,834
 Yeah, a
little, but it's okay...

261
00:19:24,917 --> 00:19:26,750
I feel fine now...

262
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,167
 You saved
my life, remember?

263
00:19:31,542 --> 00:19:32,709
Uhm, ahem!

264
00:19:32,792 --> 00:19:35,250
I don't mean to
interrupt you guys, but um...

265
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,875
I think Yamcha and I've
decided that we'd like to

266
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:41,459
spend a little
more time together...

267
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,542
So, why don't we all
go back to the city?

268
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:46,959
Pretty cool idea, huh?

269
00:19:47,042 --> 00:19:48,875
That sounds good.
But I think I'm gonna go to

270
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:51,250
Master Roshi's and
train like my Grandpa did.

271
00:19:51,334 --> 00:19:52,959
I wanna get strong!

272
00:19:53,042 --> 00:19:55,417
But Goku, you're the
strongest kid I know...

273
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,709
Yeah, but when I hit that
castle it didn't even shake!

274
00:19:58,792 --> 00:20:01,042
So if someone else can come
along and tear the whole

275
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,584
thing down, I really
need to go and train!

276
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:05,167
What are you
talking about, Goku?

277
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,959
You're the one
who destr-mmmph!

278
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,500
We'll miss you, Goku...

279
00:20:11,584 --> 00:20:13,084
And what about you, Oolong?

280
00:20:13,167 --> 00:20:14,250
Well, I dunno.

281
00:20:14,334 --> 00:20:16,459
Do you think I look
like a big city pig?

282
00:20:16,542 --> 00:20:19,625
Are you kidding?
You'll be the talk of the town!

283
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:21,667
Especially with that
underwear on your head!

284
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,500
You're just jealous 'coz I
got these from the dragon!

285
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,334
Oh well,
I guess I'll go...

286
00:20:29,417 --> 00:20:30,875
You guys need me!

287
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:32,459
I know!

288
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:34,417
When a year goes by, let's go
look for the Dragon Balls again!

289
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:37,417
 We don't need the
Dragon Balls anymore, Goku!

290
00:20:41,792 --> 00:20:43,167
Despicable!

291
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:46,250
Hey, how will I ever be
able to find my Grandpa's Dragon

292
00:20:46,334 --> 00:20:49,542
Ball if you're not there
with your radar, Bulma?

293
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,250
Well, I'll tell you what, kid.

294
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:54,209
How about I just give you this
radar as a going away present,

295
00:20:54,292 --> 00:20:57,375
to remind you of all the good
times that we had together.

296
00:20:57,459 --> 00:20:58,750
Oh wow, thank you.

297
00:21:09,459 --> 00:21:11,459
Well, here goes.

298
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,209
 I guess this
is goodbye, Goku...

299
00:21:18,292 --> 00:21:21,584
I want you to become just as
strong as Master Roshi, okay?

300
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:22,709
Okay.

301
00:21:22,792 --> 00:21:24,542
You know I'll never
forget you, Goku.

302
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:26,292
Aww.

303
00:21:27,209 --> 00:21:28,667
Flying Nimbus!

304
00:21:30,084 --> 00:21:31,459
Hey-hey!

305
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:37,084
All right, Nimbus, to
Master Roshi's, and step on it!

306
00:21:38,334 --> 00:21:39,750
You go get 'em, kid!

307
00:21:39,834 --> 00:21:41,042
You too, Oolong!

308
00:21:41,459 --> 00:21:42,709
 Hold on, everyone!

309
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,417
 Yeah!

310
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,000
 Buh-bye!

311
00:22:02,459 --> 00:22:03,834
 Bye! See ya!

312
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:10,667
I never thought that life
could be such a neat adventure!

313
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:13,750
Go!

314
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,792
 Soon, Goku's skills
will be put to the test when he

315
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:21,375
joins Master Roshi and begins
the rigors of Turtle Hermit

316
00:22:21,459 --> 00:22:25,334
Training! But what other
challenges await our young hero?

317
00:22:25,417 --> 00:22:28,500
 A new day dawns,
and a new adventure begins,

318
00:22:28,584 --> 00:22:30,834
next time on Dragon Ball!
