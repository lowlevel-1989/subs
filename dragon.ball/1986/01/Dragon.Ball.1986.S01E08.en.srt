1
00:01:47,292 --> 00:01:50,500
 Previously on Dragon
Ball, Goku and Chi-Chi searched

2
00:01:50,584 --> 00:01:53,542
for the island home of
Master Roshi, who possesses

3
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:57,750
a magic fan capable of putting
out the flames of Fire Mountain.

4
00:01:59,542 --> 00:02:01,042
 I see it
down there, ChiChi!

5
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:02,084
 Hold on.

6
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:04,292
 Hello!!

7
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:05,334
 Hmm? 

8
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,375
Hi!

9
00:02:08,584 --> 00:02:10,500
What the...
Well, I'll be darned!

10
00:02:10,584 --> 00:02:13,167
It's my young friend
with the Flying Nimbus!

11
00:02:16,917 --> 00:02:17,875
 Here we come!

12
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:21,417
You're clear for landing!

13
00:02:23,792 --> 00:02:26,750
That old guy is Master Roshi?

14
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,334
 I had a feeling
I'd see you again.

15
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:40,834
I still have the
Flying Nimbus!

16
00:02:40,917 --> 00:02:41,625
It's great!

17
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:42,584
 Still have it?

18
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:44,084
 Uh-huh.

19
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:45,584
 I'm not surprised.
Why, if I didn't know better,

20
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:48,417
I'd say that cloud
was made for you!

21
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,792
Yeah, we get along great!
We're friends now!

22
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:57,250
Hey Goku? What happened
to your friend here?

23
00:02:57,334 --> 00:03:01,834
Last time I saw her she was
taller, and, uh, prettier, and,

24
00:03:01,917 --> 00:03:04,334
well, you know, she
bigger too... heh...

25
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,625
Now she's, uh, not!

26
00:03:08,584 --> 00:03:10,792
Oh, yeah.
Well, that was Bulma,

27
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,167
but this girl's ChiChi.

28
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,792
 Her dad's
the Ox-King!

29
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:14,959
 Mm-hmm!

30
00:03:15,042 --> 00:03:16,209
 Really?

31
00:03:16,292 --> 00:03:17,709
 He's the one who
asked us to come here.

32
00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:19,584
 Mm-hmm.

33
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:23,542
 Hmm. Well,
the Ox-King, huh?

34
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:26,334
 Why, I haven't
heard from him in years.

35
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:28,042
 You know, I used
to train that little guy!

36
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,000
--
--Psst! Hey, Goku!

37
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,417
Are you sure this guy's Roshi?

38
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,834
That's him!

39
00:03:33,917 --> 00:03:36,125
Well, we'll just
see about that!

40
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,584
Before I believe that
he's a Martial Arts Master.

41
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:42,500
He's gonna have to prove it!

42
00:03:42,584 --> 00:03:44,125
Huh?

43
00:03:55,542 --> 00:03:58,084
If he can avoid
it, then he's Roshi!

44
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:11,584
Boy, that's gotta hurt.

45
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,375
The real Master Roshi
would have dodged it!

46
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,959
Why you--Nobody
could have ducked that in time!

47
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:20,334
Not even me!

48
00:04:20,417 --> 00:04:22,375
That's 'cause
you're not Master Roshi!

49
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:24,459
Now tell us who you really are!

50
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:28,667
 Look! It's
me! I am Roshi!

51
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:33,500
 Oh no! Papa's going
to kill me! I'm sorry.

52
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:37,000
Here, I'll get it.

53
00:04:37,084 --> 00:04:38,375
Crazy kids!

54
00:04:42,917 --> 00:04:45,584
The Bansho Fan?
Yes, I have that.

55
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:49,334
It's a magic fan. Wave it
once and it causes a heavy wind.

56
00:04:49,417 --> 00:04:51,584
The second time it's
waved a rain cloud appears.

57
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:54,042
And the third
time? It rains. A lot.

58
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,167
Perfect!

59
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,042
 Now hold on!
The fan is very dangerous.

60
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,292
 I'm not sure
you kids could handle it.

61
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:03,250
But we have to put out
the flames on Fire Mountain!

62
00:05:03,334 --> 00:05:06,209
 They're so hot that me
and my Papa can't get back into

63
00:05:06,292 --> 00:05:10,292
our castle.
Please help us, Master Roshi.

64
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,709
Well, the Bansho Fan
definitely could put

65
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:17,167
out that fire. And since one
good turn deserves another...

66
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,625
 Hmm... 

67
00:05:20,542 --> 00:05:24,125
 Now, let's
get this straight.

68
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:27,625
I'm going to help you with the
Bansho Fan, but I'm going to

69
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:30,125
need you to help me with
something, all right?

70
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:31,792
 Remember that
other girl you were with?

71
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,292
You mean Bulma?

72
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,000
Yeah! I was hoping you
could convince her to

73
00:05:36,084 --> 00:05:39,542
pay an old man a visit. Perhaps
take a romantic moonlight stroll

74
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,000
around the island?

75
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:42,584
But Master!

76
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:44,750
You know that dating
is against your code!

77
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:50,084
Shhh! Shhh! And it's not a
date, it's a walk. Do-gooder...

78
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:52,417
Oh, hopeless...

79
00:05:52,834 --> 00:05:55,667
Who asked you,
you goodie-goodie?!

80
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,959
Besides, can't a
fragile old man near the end

81
00:05:58,042 --> 00:06:01,667
of his end have a
little fun before he goes?

82
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:05,250
But Master, you drank
from the Fountain of Youth,

83
00:06:05,334 --> 00:06:08,459
so you know you're not
anywhere near your end!

84
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:10,459
Why you rotten, little traitor!

85
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:13,875
A walk's no big deal.
I'm sure Bulma won't mind.

86
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:16,459
There, heh, you see?

87
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:21,875
 Now listen, kid. Don't
say anything to ChiChi,

88
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,667
'cause I don't
want her dad to know.

89
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,667
Right. It's a secret!

90
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,584
 Hey ChiChi, we get
to borrow the Bansho Fan!

91
00:06:29,834 --> 00:06:32,042
 Yaay!

92
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:41,250
 Hey, Turtle?

93
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,334
 Do you remember what
I did with that blasted fan?

94
00:06:43,417 --> 00:06:45,084
 I can't find it anymore!

95
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:48,500
You were using it as a place
mat the last time I saw it.

96
00:06:48,584 --> 00:06:49,917
A place mat?!

97
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,292
Dear me! That
was the Bansho Fan?

98
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:56,292
Oh, I spilt some juice
on it, so I threw it away

99
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,042
'cause it was all sticky.

100
00:06:59,084 --> 00:07:00,917
 No...

101
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Here come the tears.

102
00:07:05,042 --> 00:07:06,917
We can't put out the fire!

103
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,584
 No Dragon Ball, either.

104
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:10,042
 Enough!

105
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,459
It looks like I'll just
have to go to Fire Mountain

106
00:07:12,542 --> 00:07:15,000
and put out those flames myself.

107
00:07:15,417 --> 00:07:18,084
You mean,
you can really do that?

108
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:23,000
Well, of course! There's
nothing Master Roshi can't do.

109
00:07:25,084 --> 00:07:27,000
 All right. Let's go.

110
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,959
 Why'd you
change your clothes?

111
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:31,709
Gotta look sharp.

112
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:34,125
There's no telling
what the day might bring!

113
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,250
Wait a second.

114
00:07:37,334 --> 00:07:40,042
You can't ride the
Flying Nimbus, can you?

115
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:43,500
Don't worry about that, son.

116
00:07:43,584 --> 00:07:45,875
I think I can find another ride.

117
00:07:47,292 --> 00:07:49,875
 Come to me, Baby Gamela!

118
00:08:00,417 --> 00:08:01,959
At your service.

119
00:08:02,042 --> 00:08:04,084
I need to take
an express spin

120
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:05,334
over to Fire Mountain.

121
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:06,542
Sure!

122
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:09,084
Okay, behave yourself.

123
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:12,542
Hey, I don't find that
the least bit funny.

124
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,209
Now don't forget:
promise me we'll have our

125
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:16,750
little talk with Bulma
as soon as we get there.

126
00:08:16,834 --> 00:08:17,917
Okay, I promise.

127
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:20,084
 We'll go on ahead
and meet you there.

128
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,292
Okay?

129
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,792
 Okay, kids!
I'll be along shortly!

130
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,042
 Do you think
he can really

131
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,959
put out Fire Mountain, Goku?

132
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:33,375
 I'll bet he can. He
said he could do anything.

133
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,667
 ♪ Buffalo gals won't
ya come out tonight, ♪

134
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,250
♪ come out tonight... ♪
I'm getting' dizzy...

135
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:47,584
What?!
The Bansho Fan is ruined?!

136
00:08:47,917 --> 00:08:49,625
 Yes, but it's
okay! He told us he

137
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:51,459
could put the fire out himself!

138
00:08:51,542 --> 00:08:54,792
That's funny, kid.
You actually fell for that?

139
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,292
I don't believe it.

140
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,625
 There he is now!!

141
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:34,875
Oh, Master Roshi!
It's really you! Ahh.

142
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,584
Master? Are you... Are you okay?

143
00:09:41,334 --> 00:09:43,875
 I'm sorry, Papa.
He wasn't like this when

144
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,125
we found him.

145
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,292
 That's the one
drawback to riding Gamela.

146
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:52,500
He makes you so darn
dizzy it's hard to adjust.

147
00:09:52,584 --> 00:09:55,000
Are you going to
put out the fire now?

148
00:09:55,084 --> 00:09:57,417
Wait! First thing's first!

149
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,792
 I've heard about
you, you big, old ox,

150
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,667
hurting people
over a silly treasure!

151
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,750
Is that how you show respect
to the master who taught you?!

152
00:10:04,834 --> 00:10:08,459
 I'm so sorry,
Master! Please forgive me!

153
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:11,000
I guess I'm not worthy.

154
00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:15,959
And here I thought
I'd seen it all.

155
00:10:16,042 --> 00:10:20,125
 I beg of you,
please forgive me Master!

156
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:22,375
 Oh, stop your
blubbering, you big oaf!

157
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:23,375
I forgive you.

158
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:27,542
 Now, you mean to
tell me that you can't

159
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,959
put out that fire yourself?
What's wrong, too old?

160
00:10:31,042 --> 00:10:33,417
 Oh, ha ha.
Yes, Master Roshi.

161
00:10:33,792 --> 00:10:36,709
Psst!
Hey, kid. The promise.

162
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,917
Oh.

163
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,750
 Okay, okay. Now what's
all this hush-hush about?

164
00:10:40,834 --> 00:10:43,709
 Well, uh. I-I
can, uh, explain.

165
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:45,375
 He wants to go
on a walk with you.

166
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:46,542
 What?

167
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:47,875
 Well, a moonlight
stroll, really.

168
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:49,750
 You mean like a date?!

169
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:52,625
 Well,
something like that.

170
00:10:54,084 --> 00:10:56,709
Now listen! I don't
where you got the idea that

171
00:10:56,792 --> 00:10:59,042
I'd wanna go on a date
with you, but I don't!

172
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,917
 I must confess,
our young friend here

173
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,500
had something to do with it.

174
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:08,000
 He said you'd walk
around my island with me

175
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,959
if I put out the fire.

176
00:11:10,042 --> 00:11:12,584
What's the big deal?
It's just a little walk.

177
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:14,375
You be quiet!

178
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,792
 'Course, I s'pose
I could just go home...

179
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,834
Fine. A walk.

180
00:11:21,917 --> 00:11:24,375
But, that's as far
as it goes, mister!

181
00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:26,917
And don't get the wrong
idea! I'm only agreeing because

182
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,750
I need those flames
put out! If you do that,

183
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:32,084
I'll go on a walk
with you. A short one.

184
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:36,167
 You got it! It's
a deal! Now promise!

185
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:40,750
 Earth, water, sea air,
I declare a pinky swear!

186
00:11:41,792 --> 00:11:44,292
How do I get
myself into these things?

187
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,125
 Hey, here they come!

188
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:49,000
 It's about time!

189
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:52,084
 It's time to cool
this mountain down!

190
00:11:52,167 --> 00:11:55,209
Sounds like he's ready
for action, doesn't it?

191
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:56,750
Yeah!

192
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:00,875
I gotta see this!

193
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:05,959
 I almost hope he
can't pull this thing off!

194
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:43,000
Well, here goes!

195
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,667
Get ready for that walk!

196
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,084
Yeah, yeah.

197
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,084
 Hey kid, could
you give me a boost?

198
00:12:59,417 --> 00:13:00,584
 Oh boy!

199
00:13:01,042 --> 00:13:03,625
So he can really do this, huh?

200
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:05,792
Don't underestimate the Master!

201
00:13:08,542 --> 00:13:09,542
Okay. Ready.

202
00:13:42,292 --> 00:13:45,667
Now watch this! It's
the Master's Kamehameha Wave!

203
00:13:49,167 --> 00:13:50,209
What's he doing?!

204
00:13:50,292 --> 00:13:52,834
Oh, I think we should
get out of here!

205
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,959
 Wait. I've heard
of this technique.

206
00:13:56,042 --> 00:13:59,375
Right now he's gathering all of
the latent energy in his body.

207
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:02,125
Then he's going to
release it all at once!

208
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:06,209
But I've... I've never
seen it in action before!

209
00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:15,667
Ka...

210
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,334
me...

211
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:19,709
ha...

212
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:25,542
me....

213
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,875
haa!

214
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:47,834
Oh, I'm pooped.

215
00:14:48,792 --> 00:14:50,042
Wowee.

216
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,167
M-M-Master, look the fire,
it's out. But you kinda...

217
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,709
Spit it out!

218
00:14:57,792 --> 00:14:59,959
Well, the mountain,
and my castle...

219
00:15:02,084 --> 00:15:04,750
 Hey, not
bad for an old man.

220
00:15:04,834 --> 00:15:06,167
 I'm not as
rusty as I thought...

221
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,584
But...it's gone!

222
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:11,542
Whoops. Sorry about that.

223
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,417
 Just look at
this rubble heap!

224
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,625
How on Earth are we going
to find that Dragon Ball?

225
00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:24,625
 Don't worry. My trusty
radar will find it for us.

226
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:27,459
I'll just adjust the
scale here. and voila!

227
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:30,750
 See, I've already
got a reading. It should be

228
00:15:30,834 --> 00:15:33,834
fifty yards in that
direction over there.

229
00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:37,209
 Thank you so much for
putting the fire out, Master.

230
00:15:37,292 --> 00:15:39,042
It feels better here already.

231
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,000
 Oh, don't
thank me. I feel bad

232
00:15:41,084 --> 00:15:42,500
about wrecking your castle.

233
00:15:42,917 --> 00:15:44,667
 Don't feel bad,
we can always build

234
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,167
ourselves a new one.

235
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,500
 So that little, old
man really is the great

236
00:15:48,584 --> 00:15:51,167
Master Roshi! Extraordinary!

237
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:55,042
That was incredible!
Can you teach me how to do that?

238
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,084
Sure, but it'll probably
take you 50 years to learn

239
00:15:57,167 --> 00:15:59,500
the Kamehameha Wave.

240
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,042
Aww, Fifty years.

241
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:08,542
 Are we there yet?

242
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,667
 Almost. We're
really close now.

243
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,084
 Master, won't you
stay here and live with us?

244
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:17,334
Thanks, but I really
do enjoy living by myself.

245
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,625
Ka...

246
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,500
me...ha...me...

247
00:16:26,417 --> 00:16:28,584
ha!

248
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:41,500
Aww, but it wasn't even close
to what the Turtle Hermit did.

249
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:44,709
Excellent!
Well, that's Gohan's grandson!

250
00:16:44,792 --> 00:16:47,042
What?
Goku is Gohan's grandson?!

251
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,959
Yes. But I thought
you knew that already.

252
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,917
No, I didn't.

253
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,584
 Ohh, I remember Gohan
speaking of a child with a tail.

254
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:58,334
 So that's him, huh?

255
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:04,000
 Gohan must be
training the boy himself.

256
00:17:04,667 --> 00:17:07,542
So tell me, kid. How
is your Grandpa doing?

257
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:10,000
Grandpa died
a long time ago.

258
00:17:10,084 --> 00:17:15,959
He did! Oh, I see.
I'm very sorry to hear that.

259
00:17:17,292 --> 00:17:19,667
Hey. I've got
a great idea.

260
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,959
Why don't you come to
stay with me on my island

261
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:23,584
and I'll train you personally!

262
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,417
Ooh, it would be
a great honor to have

263
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,959
the same teacher my Grandpa had!

264
00:17:28,834 --> 00:17:30,792
 What's this?
Master Roshi doesn't

265
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,542
take on students
easily. And there he is,

266
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,959
asking little monkey boy.

267
00:17:36,042 --> 00:17:38,500
 Maybe we should just
forget about the Dragon Balls.

268
00:17:38,584 --> 00:17:40,292
Hey, no wait. All
we have to do is grab that

269
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,042
stupid little tail
of his and he'll be

270
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,709
like putty in our hands.

271
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:47,209
But what if we're not
able to get to his tail, Yamcha?

272
00:17:47,292 --> 00:17:50,375
Just leave that to
me and my Wolf Fang Fist.

273
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,792
 This is ridiculous,
Bulma. I'm calling it quits.

274
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:03,375
 Well, it's got
to be here somewhere.

275
00:18:05,917 --> 00:18:06,834
I found it!

276
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:12,042
 Yeah! Check it out!
Now there's only one more to go!

277
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,084
Fabulous!

278
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:17,125
 Woo-hoo! Yippee!

279
00:18:17,209 --> 00:18:19,500
 Sounds like
Bulma found it.

280
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:23,250
Hey, who did this?

281
00:18:23,334 --> 00:18:24,292
I did!

282
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,667
You blew up our car,
you dummy!

283
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,417
Please, take one of my cars.

284
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,750
 Oh my gosh.

285
00:18:29,834 --> 00:18:33,000
 The boy has
done so well today.

286
00:18:33,417 --> 00:18:36,209
I think he deserves a
little reward, don't you?

287
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:41,667
Oh my. Thank you!

288
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,542
Thanks Ox-King!
I really like it!

289
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:48,667
That last ball's
pretty far... Wow.

290
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,417
 I'm going to have
to switch my radar over

291
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,209
to long range.

292
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:57,042
 Ah, there it is.
All right you guys.

293
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,292
C'mon, let's go!

294
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:03,792
--Goodbye! You've been great!
--Goodbye! Thanks for the ride!

295
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,459
 And thank you so
much for the Dragon Ball!

296
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:10,250
Hold it!! Have you
forgotten something?

297
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:11,709
Your promise!

298
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:16,000
Yeah, I remember.
The promise. Right.

299
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:18,500
 Oolong!

300
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,584
 Quiet! Listen!

301
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:25,334
I promised that old goat
I'd take some stupid walk

302
00:19:25,417 --> 00:19:28,084
with him around his
island. Well, I just don't have

303
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,167
the time for that. I
need you to change shape

304
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,917
and take my place.

305
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:33,959
No arguing!

306
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:35,459
You do it or I'll
say the "P" word!

307
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:37,334
Now you listen
here, sister!

308
00:19:37,417 --> 00:19:39,875
Go ahead and do your worst,
because I will not stoop

309
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:43,750
that low! I do have some
semblance of dignity left.

310
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:46,500
Okay, have it
your way, piggy.

311
00:19:46,584 --> 00:19:48,917
Alright, alright,
I'll do it!

312
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,125
 ♪ Buffalo girls won't
you come out tonight. ♪ 

313
00:19:52,209 --> 00:19:54,417
 ♪ Doot doo doo... ♪

314
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:58,625
How's this??

315
00:19:58,709 --> 00:20:01,292
That looks nothing
like me you moron!

316
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:03,709
Well, excuse me.

317
00:20:05,459 --> 00:20:07,375
There, how's this?
You satisfied?

318
00:20:07,459 --> 00:20:09,875
Great! That's perfect!
Now, you just disguise your

319
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:12,959
voice make sure that old geezer
doesn't know the difference!

320
00:20:13,042 --> 00:20:14,000
Dumb bunny.

321
00:20:14,584 --> 00:20:16,250
 Master Roshi!

322
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,875
 All right. Let's
see how Bulma likes this!

323
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:22,625
Now I know we only planned
on a moonlight stroll,

324
00:20:22,709 --> 00:20:23,667
but as long as you're
coming to the island--

325
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,209
Master Roshi...

326
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:28,000
Yes, what is it,
my sweet?

327
00:20:28,084 --> 00:20:32,167
You are so incredibly sexy.

328
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,250
I just loved the way
you blew up that mountain!

329
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:37,709
Well you know,
just one of the things I do.

330
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:40,959
Even now, my heart's
still beating like a drum!

331
00:20:41,042 --> 00:20:43,125
--Boom-boom!
--Boom-boom! Boom-boom!

332
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:46,917
What does that stupid
pig think he's doing?!

333
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,625
Just look...

334
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:54,375
 can't you tell?

335
00:20:54,459 --> 00:20:55,834
 Boom-boom!

336
00:20:57,459 --> 00:20:58,834
 Boom-boom!

337
00:21:01,584 --> 00:21:03,125
 Boom-boom!

338
00:21:03,209 --> 00:21:07,584
Roshi, you are truly
the luckiest man alive.

339
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:09,459
 What were you
thinking, Oolong?!

340
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:12,750
I'm so mad at you right
now I could just--ooh!

341
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:16,750
What's up?

342
00:21:16,834 --> 00:21:17,917
Oh, nothing.

343
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,834
I was just wondering
if you're ever going

344
00:21:19,917 --> 00:21:22,209
to think about me again.

345
00:21:22,292 --> 00:21:23,959
Yeah, I think so.

346
00:21:24,042 --> 00:21:26,042
Oh my, you're so funny.

347
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,792
Do you think you're
ever going to think

348
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,709
about me again, ChiChi?

349
00:21:30,792 --> 00:21:32,125
Oh my gosh!

350
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,750
-- Bye-bye!
-- See you later!

351
00:21:36,834 --> 00:21:39,625
--Thanks again!
--We'll miss you!

352
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,542
 Thanks for
the Dragon Ball!

353
00:21:45,917 --> 00:21:48,167
Looks like it's time
to be on our way, Puar.

354
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:51,584
We've got to follow those three
to the last of the Dragon Balls.

355
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:52,959
Okay!

356
00:21:53,584 --> 00:21:54,542
 Ready for takeoff!

357
00:22:01,417 --> 00:22:02,792
 Whoa!

358
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,875
Flying's definitely the
way to go! This is great!

359
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,584
It's incredible!

360
00:22:12,334 --> 00:22:14,959
 Yamcha will be
keeping a close eye on our

361
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:18,042
heroes as they embark on their
journey towards the seventh,

362
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:21,042
and final, Dragon
Ball. Tune in next time,

363
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:23,292
as the adventure continues!
