1
00:01:58,209 --> 00:02:00,667
 Goku and Bulma
have their five Dragon Balls,

2
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,792
and are crossing the desert
in search of the sixth.

3
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:06,417
 But a treacherous
plan is being hatched to

4
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,625
spoil their mission.

5
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:17,292
Let's get going, Puar.
We can't let those three slip

6
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:18,375
through our fingers.

7
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:20,459
Huh? But what about the girl,
Yamcha?

8
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:21,875
Remember?

9
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,334
Leave that to me.
I've got a plan.

10
00:02:33,792 --> 00:02:36,417
So, why didn't you tell
us before that you had this

11
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,709
camper Dyno-Cap, Oolong? Hmm?

12
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:42,125
Well you didn't exactly ask me,
now did you?

13
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:44,792
Besides, I didn't want
those bandits to steal it.

14
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,459
 Kid, watch
yourself, you're gonna choke.

15
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,584
Mmm...This is good.

16
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:52,084
I hope I see Yamcha again.

17
00:02:52,167 --> 00:02:54,875
He was so shy and so handsome...

18
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,584
 Does this
place have a tub?

19
00:02:56,667 --> 00:02:58,459
 Yeah, right in there.

20
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:03,125
 Huh. To
tell you the truth,

21
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:04,875
I'm used to much
nicer accommodations.

22
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,542
 Then why don't you try
a luxury hotel down the road?

23
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:10,209
I'm sure there are lots of
'em out here in the desert!

24
00:03:10,292 --> 00:03:12,084
It's just that it's so small.

25
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:14,125
Well it ain't no palace,
but I don't see any

26
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:16,167
royalty around either,
get it?

27
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:19,459
Now what are you looking for?

28
00:03:20,084 --> 00:03:21,250
 Peepholes.

29
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,292
Hey! What kind of place
you think I'm runnin'?!

30
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,084
Well, I wouldn't
put it past you.

31
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:26,334
What?

32
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:28,000
 You little perv.

33
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:32,917
 I'll let you
win the battle, sister,

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
but I'm gonna win the war.

35
00:04:15,334 --> 00:04:18,417
 Emperor. Spy pods
are now in position.

36
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,709
We are ready to put
operation "Desert Dragon Bomb"

37
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:22,000
into effect. Over.

38
00:04:22,084 --> 00:04:27,000
Good. Proceed as planned,
Agent Mai. Base out.

39
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:29,625
 Let's go!

40
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,959
 Come on!

41
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,459
 It's set to go
off in four minutes.

42
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:47,709
 Huh?

43
00:04:49,292 --> 00:04:50,667
Shu, somebody's out there!

44
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,375
 Hm?

45
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:52,459
Let's get out of here.

46
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,167
 Mai, I think
we have a problem.

47
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,000
The bomb is stuck to my hand.

48
00:04:57,084 --> 00:04:58,709
This isn't good, Shu!

49
00:04:58,792 --> 00:05:00,167
What should I do?!

50
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,375
You better wait here.
I'll go get help.

51
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:07,417
 Hey, wait for me!

52
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:12,125
 Mm-hmm...a
double-decker camper.

53
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:15,000
I'll bet we can get a decent
price for a rig like that.

54
00:05:15,084 --> 00:05:17,042
But what about the girl?

55
00:05:19,167 --> 00:05:23,000
Easy. All we have to do
is find a way to lure her

56
00:05:23,084 --> 00:05:26,042
out of there for a few minutes.
Then we sneak in and

57
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,959
rob them blind! Ha ha ha!

58
00:05:28,042 --> 00:05:30,000
 You're
starting to scare me.

59
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:31,834
You think we're safe out here?

60
00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:34,542
Don't worry! The worst
thing that could happen to us

61
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,000
is they take our stuff.

62
00:05:37,042 --> 00:05:39,750
That's it, huh? Well I
don't know if you've noticed,

63
00:05:39,834 --> 00:05:42,959
but I've got some
very serious cargo here.

64
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:44,917
You're not worried,
'cause you don't

65
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,375
have anything worth stealing.

66
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:48,292
Yeah-huh. My Dragon Ball.

67
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:51,584
Huh? Dragon Ball?
What's that?

68
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:53,584
 Well, Bulma asked
me not to show you,

69
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:55,042
but...I guess it's okay.

70
00:05:56,417 --> 00:05:57,375
Neat, huh?

71
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:12,750
--
--

72
00:06:38,334 --> 00:06:40,417
Okay, she's right above us.

73
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,875
 Master, can you see if
the other two are with her?

74
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:45,875
Hang on.

75
00:06:53,584 --> 00:06:55,959
Yamcha?! What happened?!
Are you all right?!

76
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:57,334
 Hmm? 

77
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,375
Is something out there?

78
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:05,417
Hm? Oh well.

79
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:10,125
I hate turning
into a bowl of mush

80
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:11,709
everytime I see a girl!

81
00:07:11,792 --> 00:07:13,167
It's not your fault...

82
00:07:13,792 --> 00:07:14,709
 Hmm?

83
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:15,917
I think I hear something.

84
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,542
 Are you sure it's true?

85
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,459
It's the pig
and the kid. Hmph.

86
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:22,000
 So, when you get all
seven Dragon Balls together,

87
00:07:22,084 --> 00:07:24,042
the Dragon appears
and grants a wish?

88
00:07:25,084 --> 00:07:27,209
 Uh-huh. Yep, that's
right.

89
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:28,959
 Any wish
you can think of?

90
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:31,000
Guess so.
That's what Bulma said.

91
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:33,625
So, how many more
Dragon Balls do you need?

92
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:35,042
Just two.

93
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,334
 Heh! We're on to
something really big here,

94
00:07:37,417 --> 00:07:38,709
Goku old pal!

95
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,167
--Come on.
--Right!

96
00:07:42,542 --> 00:07:44,417
Well, it seems
we hit the jackpot!

97
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,625
Yeah?

98
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:47,500
Puar, you know what
this means, don't you?!

99
00:07:47,584 --> 00:07:49,459
What Yamcha?

100
00:07:49,542 --> 00:07:54,500
I will never be shy
around women again! Never!

101
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:58,334
But Yamcha, if you
could have any wish,

102
00:07:58,417 --> 00:08:01,584
then you could rule the world
and have all the riches in it.

103
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,792
Come on! How long
have you been with me?

104
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:08,125
 It's been two years,
one month, and three days.

105
00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:10,625
After all this time,
I thought you really

106
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:12,250
would have
known me by now.

107
00:08:12,334 --> 00:08:13,625
 I thought so too...

108
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:15,917
Well, my furry
friend, you don't.

109
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,625
I have no aspirations
to rule the world. Understand?

110
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:21,625
I think I do...

111
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:25,792
 No... I want what no
riches in the world can buy...

112
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:29,667
Don't you see that one
day I'd like to get married?

113
00:08:30,084 --> 00:08:32,709
Or at least be
able to ask a girl out

114
00:08:32,792 --> 00:08:35,250
on one single, lousy date!

115
00:08:35,334 --> 00:08:37,209
See what happens
when you don't have

116
00:08:37,292 --> 00:08:38,875
an afternoon nap, Master?

117
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:45,542
From now on,
we have only those

118
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:50,459
Dragon Balls in our sights!
We'll get them. Mark my words.

119
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:52,875
You know, kid?
We need to cut Bulma out.

120
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,542
That's all there is to it.

121
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,417
But Bulma and I are partners.

122
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,792
Why would you
want to cut her out?

123
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:01,250
Look, kid, she's
a girl and we're guys.

124
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,542
And we're going to want
to wish for some guy things.

125
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:09,625
Like, a harem with
three-hundred girls!

126
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,542
Golly, why would you
wanna have three-hundred girls?

127
00:09:14,542 --> 00:09:16,084
Huh? How's that, kid?

128
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:18,250
Well, can you imagine
what it would be like

129
00:09:18,334 --> 00:09:20,292
having three-hundred
Bulmas to listen to?

130
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,500
How dare you talk
behind my back, Goku?!

131
00:09:24,584 --> 00:09:27,459
I was just, uh...
Oh, nevermind.

132
00:09:27,542 --> 00:09:30,500
Oolong, do you have
any extra pajamas?

133
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:33,500
Oh, like mine
would fit you.

134
00:09:33,584 --> 00:09:36,875
 So what am I
supposed to wear to bed, then?

135
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,792
What am I,
your butler?!

136
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,709
Well, with that
hat you look like one.

137
00:09:41,792 --> 00:09:45,834
 Or a limo driver,
or something.

138
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:49,292
 Here you go. This cold
juice will calm your nerves.

139
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,625
You can be a sweet swine,
can't you?

140
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:54,000
More than you'll ever know.

141
00:09:54,084 --> 00:09:56,042
Aw, thank you.

142
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:03,667
Eww, this stuff's gross!

143
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,209
 It's for,
uh, health nuts.

144
00:10:05,292 --> 00:10:07,375
It's, uh, supposed
to make you strong.

145
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:09,417
Oh well.
Down the hatch.

146
00:10:13,042 --> 00:10:15,000
I do feel stronger!

147
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,709
You want some, Oolong?

148
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:20,750
Oh, for me?
I, uh, had mine already.

149
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:27,042
So where do I sleep?
I'm tired...

150
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,167
Just go right up
those stairs there.

151
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,209
 Good night.

152
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:34,250
And you better
not come up here!

153
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:36,959
Or I'll just have to make
the 'piggy' sound again,

154
00:10:37,042 --> 00:10:39,709
and you'll be going "Wee, wee
wee! All the way home"! Get it?

155
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:40,959
Gotcha.

156
00:10:41,042 --> 00:10:42,959
 And since you're
not doing anything,

157
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,917
I want my clothes
cleaned by morning.

158
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,084
Right.

159
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:52,542
Boy, the way
she was nagging me,

160
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,500
you would think we
were married or something.

161
00:10:54,584 --> 00:10:57,459
I'll never understand women.

162
00:10:57,542 --> 00:10:58,584
Huh?

163
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:05,375
 That sleeping powder
works faster than I thought!

164
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:07,709
 Stealing the Dragon
Balls is gonna be a cinch

165
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,584
with these kids knocked out!

166
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:26,584
 Uh-oh!

167
00:11:27,084 --> 00:11:28,000
 Hurry, Shu!

168
00:11:28,084 --> 00:11:32,292
Something's wrong!
It won't stop!

169
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,334
It's gonna blow in
less than a minute!

170
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,375
Oh, what am I gonna do?
I'm too young to blow up...

171
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,875
What happened?
Tell me, Shu!

172
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,625
Nothing to worry about,
Mai.

173
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:53,334
I reset it for eight
o'clock tomorrow morning.

174
00:11:53,417 --> 00:11:54,417
Then: boom.

175
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:07,000
 I bet the Dragon
Balls are upstairs...

176
00:12:07,084 --> 00:12:09,042
and I know the first
place I'm gonna look.

177
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:16,250
It's all clear, Yamcha.

178
00:12:16,334 --> 00:12:18,667
All right, Puar.
This is it. You know what to do?

179
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,542
Uh-huh!

180
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:41,125
What's that?!

181
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:45,375
This kid is really zonked out!

182
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,709
I wonder where the
other two have gone?

183
00:12:48,792 --> 00:12:50,250
I guess they're upstairs.

184
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:53,125
Puar, I want you to
change into this kid here

185
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:55,292
and lure the
others outside, okay?

186
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,334
Okay!

187
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,709
How could Goku be awake
after that dose I gave him?!

188
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:09,209
 I don't get it!
I put enough in his drink

189
00:13:09,292 --> 00:13:11,000
to knock out a horse!

190
00:13:11,084 --> 00:13:14,459
 If that little imp
catches me up here, he's sure to

191
00:13:14,542 --> 00:13:17,334
squeal to Bulma and
she'll fry my bacon good!

192
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:18,750
I gotta think of something fast!

193
00:13:18,834 --> 00:13:19,792
Oh, I know!

194
00:13:24,834 --> 00:13:26,834
Oh, hi, Goku!
You scared me!

195
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:28,875
 Hey.
Where's Oolong?

196
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:31,750
Oolong?

197
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:34,000
I thought he went for a
walk? I thought he was back!

198
00:13:34,084 --> 00:13:35,417
 Hey, I know!

199
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,667
Let's go outside
and look for him!

200
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,959
There's something I wanna
show you out there, anyway.

201
00:13:41,042 --> 00:13:42,625
Well, um, all right.

202
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:53,042
 Looks like Oolong
hasn't come back yet!

203
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,209
 I have a feeling
he's pretty close by!

204
00:13:56,292 --> 00:13:58,959
With her out of the way,
nothing can stop me!

205
00:13:59,042 --> 00:14:02,209
Strange, though. In the daylight
she seemed much prettier...

206
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:10,667
 Ah-ha!

207
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:16,667
I betcha I know what's
under here: Dragon Balls!

208
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,209
Odd. They seem...
kinda flimsy...

209
00:14:26,584 --> 00:14:29,292
I'm freezing!
What do you want to show me?!

210
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:34,500
It's right up here.
Now, watch real close!

211
00:14:34,584 --> 00:14:35,500
What in the world?!

212
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:36,542
Tricked you good, huh?

213
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:39,959
You wanna make a bet?!

214
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:41,042
Oolong?! But--!

215
00:14:46,917 --> 00:14:48,042
Master!

216
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,875
Come back here!

217
00:14:57,084 --> 00:14:58,667
Are you okay?!

218
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:04,250
Not... Dragon Balls...
Not... Dragon Balls...

219
00:15:04,334 --> 00:15:05,709
My poor master!

220
00:15:07,042 --> 00:15:09,334
 Hey!
Where are you?!

221
00:15:09,417 --> 00:15:12,709
 Come on, Yamcha!
Let's go! Come on, come on!

222
00:15:12,792 --> 00:15:18,584
 Not... Dragon Balls...
Not... Dragon Balls...

223
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,709
It's like a thieves
convention here!

224
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,500
It's about time.

225
00:15:34,584 --> 00:15:36,667
Oh, good morning.

226
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,584
Yeah, for you, maybe.
Nice sleep?

227
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:41,625
Huh?

228
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:45,125
Oh... I have a
terrible headache...

229
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:48,875
Hey, Oolong, did you
get my clothes clean yet?

230
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,417
Sorry, I've been a little busy.

231
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,334
What?! What do you mean 'busy'?!
This is serious!

232
00:15:55,417 --> 00:15:57,167
I don't have any
clothes to wear!

233
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,834
I mean busy saving
your hides from Yamcha.

234
00:16:00,917 --> 00:16:01,875
Yamcha?

235
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,792
 Wow, he came back!

236
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:09,542
Were you nice to him?
Yamcha's real shy, you know?

237
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,792
I think I'm gonna puke.

238
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,459
What did you say?!

239
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:16,334
Nothing.
And if you really need clothes,

240
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:18,875
there's one outfit in
the drawer upstairs.

241
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,542
Why didn't you just
say so in the first place?!

242
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:22,959
Hmph!

243
00:16:23,042 --> 00:16:26,000
Yeah. come to think of it,
maybe three-hundred girls

244
00:16:26,084 --> 00:16:28,042
is a few too many, little buddy.

245
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,500
 So, does that mean
you're changing your mind

246
00:16:31,584 --> 00:16:32,542
about the harem thing?

247
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:33,625
 Yup!

248
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:36,250
Gee, you sure are one smart pig,
Oolong.

249
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,042
I'm hungry.

250
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,084
You are always hungry, kid.

251
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,542
 What?! You
two failed me again?!

252
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:57,709
Next time I'll know
better than to get my spies

253
00:16:57,792 --> 00:16:59,375
from the want ads!

254
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:02,292
Sorry, sir. But we've
already reprogrammed the bomb.

255
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,000
It's set to blow at eight.

256
00:17:04,084 --> 00:17:05,917
What? At eight?

257
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,250
 Why, that's
just an hour away.

258
00:17:08,334 --> 00:17:10,667
All right, but no more mistakes!

259
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,834
 Yes, sir.
Agent Mai out.

260
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:18,584
A month's supply of food gone!

261
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:20,834
Hey, what's this? Easter?!

262
00:17:20,917 --> 00:17:23,709
This is no outfit,
it's a costume!

263
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,084
And I look ridiculous in it,
Oolong!

264
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:29,167
Well, tough luck!
That's all I've got.

265
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,834
My stock of women's
clothes is down this month.

266
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:34,709
Hmph. You know, there's
something not quite right

267
00:17:34,792 --> 00:17:37,959
about you, Oolong, but I
just can't quite figure it out.

268
00:17:38,042 --> 00:17:39,375
I'm a pig?

269
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:42,625
Whew, me too!
Ha ha, that was great!

270
00:17:47,084 --> 00:17:50,542
 So why am I driving?
I just hate driving!

271
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:51,959
 Oh, quit
your complaining.

272
00:17:52,042 --> 00:17:53,875
I'm putting on my make-up.

273
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:56,917
Kid, this girl's
a pain in the neck.

274
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,125
Tell me if you see Yamcha.

275
00:18:06,542 --> 00:18:09,625
Yeah, we'll keep our
fingers crossed, Bulma.

276
00:18:09,709 --> 00:18:11,500
Oh, can't wait to see him.

277
00:18:15,417 --> 00:18:16,375
Is that him?

278
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,625
Wow!
That Yamcha's such a hunk!

279
00:18:27,584 --> 00:18:29,292
 Steady Puar.

280
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,334
That's it!

281
00:18:31,834 --> 00:18:34,000
Oh!
He's looking right at me!

282
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:37,459
Uh-oh.

283
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:50,334
What's the big idea?!
Are you two nuts?!

284
00:18:51,334 --> 00:18:53,292
 Don't worry
about the girl, master.

285
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,417
I bet she got
knocked out in the crash.

286
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,084
Okay. Game's up.

287
00:18:57,167 --> 00:19:01,042
Listen. Now give me the
Dragon Balls or you will die!

288
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:02,875
Goku,
how does that goon know

289
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:03,917
about the Dragon Balls?!

290
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,042
Stop your gawking
and hand them over, now!

291
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,917
I'll hand over this!

292
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:13,834
Goku, he's got a gun!

293
00:19:13,917 --> 00:19:15,750
I couldn't possibly
turn down a fight

294
00:19:15,834 --> 00:19:18,167
with Gohan's grandson, Puar.

295
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,709
So, you little runt,
you want another spanking

296
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:22,709
from my Wolf's Fang Fist?!

297
00:19:22,792 --> 00:19:28,750
I was hungry last time,
but now my stomach's full!

298
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,542
Atta boy!

299
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,417
Have you had enough yet?

300
00:19:40,584 --> 00:19:42,750
Yamcha, let's
get out--Oh no!

301
00:19:42,834 --> 00:19:44,625
Look at your teeth!

302
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,459
 Oh no, look at me!
Now I'll never get a date!

303
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,792
 I won't forget
this, kid! I'll be back!

304
00:20:03,542 --> 00:20:04,417
That was strange.

305
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,125
Wow, Goku!
You were phenomenal!

306
00:20:07,209 --> 00:20:08,750
You really showed him!

307
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:11,375
Thanks, Oolong.
I think we'd better

308
00:20:11,459 --> 00:20:12,792
go check on Bulma.

309
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,625
 Hope she's in better
shape than our ride...

310
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,417
I guess we
underestimated that kid.

311
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,917
He knows his stuff.

312
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,167
But we can use that
to our advantage, Puar.

313
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,375
We'll just let them find
all of the Dragon Balls.

314
00:20:31,459 --> 00:20:34,459
Then, when they have all
seven, we'll make our strike.

315
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:38,125
Yamcha, you are the greatest!
You are!

316
00:20:44,292 --> 00:20:46,084
Looks like that
bomb did the trick.

317
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:49,125
Those poor shmucks
never knew what hit 'em.

318
00:20:49,209 --> 00:20:52,125
That's strange.
It blew before eight o'clock.

319
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,542
Don't worry about it.

320
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,584
Pilaf probably got
those bombs on sale.

321
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:57,875
 I'm going to check
inside for the Dragon Balls.

322
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:05,459
I wonder how
Bulma stayed out of

323
00:21:05,542 --> 00:21:06,792
trouble before she met me.

324
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:09,375
Hey, why don't you let
me carry her little buddy?

325
00:21:09,459 --> 00:21:11,917
I'd be happy to give
her - er, you a hand.

326
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:14,500
 Hey, you guys!

327
00:21:14,584 --> 00:21:15,542
Over here!

328
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:20,375
Ah! Look, kid!
It's him!

329
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:22,042
 Wait, wait, wait,
wait! Hello there!

330
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:25,709
We were talking and, uh, oh
well, we really don't want to

331
00:21:25,792 --> 00:21:27,709
have any hard
feelings between us.

332
00:21:29,584 --> 00:21:32,417
Ha, it was a fair
fight, so, here you go!

333
00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:37,459
What's the catch?

334
00:21:37,542 --> 00:21:41,709
There is no catch, my friends.
Goodbye!

335
00:21:41,792 --> 00:21:43,042
Have a good day!

336
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,209
Man. What's up with him?

337
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:49,542
I guess deep down,
he's really a good guy.

338
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:52,417
Yeah, bologna.
I don't buy it.

339
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,292
I better check
this thing for bombs.

340
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:58,459
Sometimes you have
to trust in people.

341
00:21:58,542 --> 00:21:59,709
 Yeah, right.

342
00:22:03,542 --> 00:22:07,417
 There they go, Yamcha.
Your homing device is working!

343
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:17,417
Shu... are we still alive...?

344
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,000
I think so...

345
00:22:24,167 --> 00:22:27,125
 Even with the odds
stacked against them, our heroes

346
00:22:27,209 --> 00:22:29,959
continue their trek across
the desert in search of the

347
00:22:30,042 --> 00:22:33,042
elusive Dragon Balls.
What perils await them?

348
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:36,625
 Will they survive?
