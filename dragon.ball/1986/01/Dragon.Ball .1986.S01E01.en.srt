1
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,667
 Far away,
in an enchanted land

2
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,084
that seemed untouched
by the steady march of time,

3
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:59,584
there lived an old master
named Gohan who found

4
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:03,375
a baby boy abandoned in
the wilderness of the region.

5
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:06,709
The old master raised
the boy as his own child

6
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:09,167
and marveled as
the youngster grew

7
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,125
and became uncommonly strong.

8
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:15,625
Now the boy,
known as Goku, is on his own,

9
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:18,500
and has become the sole
guardian of his grandfather's

10
00:02:18,584 --> 00:02:22,584
most mystical possession--
his Dragon Ball!

11
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:56,042
Hi! Just hanging around, huh?

12
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:13,709
 Yeah!

13
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,834
 Hiyaaah!

14
00:03:55,792 --> 00:03:58,459
Well, that takes care of that.

15
00:03:58,542 --> 00:04:00,542
I'm hungry! Whoa!

16
00:04:01,334 --> 00:04:03,417
 Little did
Goku know, a visitor was

17
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,917
approaching his
remote mountainside home.

18
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,959
The young boy's life
was about to begin

19
00:04:08,042 --> 00:04:09,792
a radical new phase.

20
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,000
Totally radical!

21
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,500
Let's see here.
Oh, yeah, there it is!

22
00:04:23,584 --> 00:04:26,125
 You're as good
as mine, you little jewel!

23
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,875
 I'm going to
go get some food.

24
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:41,417
Grandpa, stay there, okay?

25
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,292
 This won't take long.
I'll be right back.

26
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:48,584
Huh...?!

27
00:04:50,584 --> 00:04:52,709
Uh. Golly,
I've never seen you

28
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,792
shine bright like that
before, Grandpa!

29
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:58,000
How strange!
Can you do it again?

30
00:04:59,334 --> 00:05:01,459
You can wait until
later if you have to.

31
00:05:01,542 --> 00:05:03,417
 I'll see you
in a little while.

32
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,250
 Now what should
I have to eat today?

33
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,834
Gosh, it's so hard to decide.

34
00:05:11,917 --> 00:05:14,084
Why don't you decide, tummy.

35
00:05:14,167 --> 00:05:16,125
Fish?

36
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:18,167
 Fish! Yeah! Ha-ha!

37
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,542
That sounds really great!

38
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:21,959
Alright!

39
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,834
 Ah, but first, I'm
going to need a little snack!

40
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:40,167
That was good.

41
00:05:41,292 --> 00:05:42,584
Arh!

42
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:44,875
 Huh?

43
00:05:47,584 --> 00:05:48,584
Hm?

44
00:05:52,084 --> 00:05:53,500
Missed me!

45
00:05:58,084 --> 00:06:00,209
 C'mon...!
Catch me if you can!

46
00:06:01,834 --> 00:06:03,209
 You're almost there!

47
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:16,709
Uh. Uh-ah!

48
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,834
That was great!

49
00:06:27,042 --> 00:06:29,125
 Mm. There.
That oughta do it!

50
00:06:29,209 --> 00:06:31,834
It'll be dry in no time!

51
00:06:31,917 --> 00:06:34,584
Here comes the waterfall!

52
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:36,625
Huh? Hey!
It looks like now

53
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:39,125
is a good time to do
a little tail-fishing.

54
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,334
 Come on,
you little rasals.

55
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:46,250
I know you think
it's a giant worm.

56
00:06:46,334 --> 00:06:48,459
Take a bite!

57
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,709
Wow! That's
what I call a fish!

58
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,750
This oughta
last me until dinner!

59
00:07:15,417 --> 00:07:18,084
Huh? What's that noise?

60
00:07:24,084 --> 00:07:26,042
 Aaahhh!

61
00:07:26,584 --> 00:07:28,584
Yikes! Is he dead?!

62
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:32,667
What the--?!

63
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,250
Wow! You're alive?!

64
00:07:34,334 --> 00:07:36,959
Rrrgh! So you thought
you finished me off?

65
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:38,625
Well, you're not going to
get my fish that easy,

66
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:40,250
you big monster!

67
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:43,209
 Ahh...! Stop it!
What are you doing?!

68
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,667
This is for hitting me!

69
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:55,250
There! That'll teach
you to try to take my fish!

70
00:07:55,334 --> 00:07:57,125
Sneaking up on me like that!

71
00:07:57,209 --> 00:07:59,000
 Well, I'm ready
for you this time!

72
00:07:59,084 --> 00:08:01,875
Why don't you come out
of your shell and fight!

73
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,875
What's wrong?!
Don't tell me you used up

74
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,959
all of your
power already, monster!

75
00:08:06,042 --> 00:08:07,250
Not quite...!

76
00:08:07,334 --> 00:08:08,750
 Ow! Ooh!

77
00:08:11,417 --> 00:08:12,875
Uh. Hm?

78
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:18,959
Holy cow! Whoa!
What was that?!

79
00:08:19,042 --> 00:08:22,125
But... How'd you...?
You shouldn't be alive, kid!

80
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:24,584
 So you thought you
finished me off again, huh?!

81
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:26,667
Well Grandpa told me about
evil creatures like you.

82
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,667
Your black arts
won't work on me!

83
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,750
Alright monster!
It's your turn!

84
00:08:31,834 --> 00:08:34,334
Monster? Hold on!
I'm not a monster, kid!

85
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:37,042
I'm a human being!
Just like you are!

86
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:40,625
 You are?!
Uh, ugh... Really?!

87
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:43,125
Yes! Uhh...

88
00:08:43,209 --> 00:08:44,500
 Of course, I am!

89
00:08:44,584 --> 00:08:45,584
 Uh...

90
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:48,209
You can see that
for yourself. Can't you?

91
00:08:48,292 --> 00:08:49,875
Look. I won't bite.

92
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:51,917
Uh! Stay back.

93
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,584
A human you say?

94
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:54,667
 That's right.
Wanna to see my

95
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,167
certificate of authenticity?

96
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,709
 No thanks.

97
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:02,584
How long is this
going to take?

98
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,084
Will you hush up?

99
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:05,834
Well, you look human enough.

100
00:09:05,917 --> 00:09:08,042
But you're different.
You're thin and scrawny.

101
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,500
I'm a girl, silly. That's why.

102
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:13,709
A girl? Oh, so
that's what you are.

103
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:16,209
Oh my gosh!
Are you saying you've never

104
00:09:16,292 --> 00:09:17,459
seen a girl before?!

105
00:09:17,542 --> 00:09:18,917
 Nope!
Besides my grandpa,

106
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,834
you're the only human being
that I've ever seen!

107
00:09:21,917 --> 00:09:22,875
Uh?

108
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,792
But Grandpa
told me about girls.

109
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,625
He told me that
if I ever ran into a girl,

110
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:29,417
that I should be as polite
as I possibly could.

111
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,667
I see. Well!
What a nice thing to say!

112
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,584
Your grandpa sounds like
a very wise man. Is he?

113
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:39,084
 Well, he was!
He died a long time ago!

114
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:41,125
Huh?

115
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:43,417
Shame on you! What do
you think you're doing?!

116
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,500
I was just checking
to see if you had a tail.

117
00:09:46,584 --> 00:09:48,459
Huh? Oh...

118
00:09:48,542 --> 00:09:50,417
 Don't worry!
Maybe it just takes girls

119
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,209
longer to grow theirs!

120
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:55,625
 Ah-heh. I'm sure it'll
sprout up any time now, kid!

121
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:57,709
What a weirdo!

122
00:09:57,792 --> 00:09:59,500
 How did you
get that monster to do

123
00:09:59,584 --> 00:10:01,292
what you wanted it to do?

124
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:04,875
That's not a monster, silly.
That's a car.

125
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:07,542
Oh, so this is a car.

126
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:08,667
Grandpa told me about them

127
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,167
but I've never
actually seen one!

128
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,084
 You know, for a little
kid, you're really strong!

129
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:18,959
Thanks! Grandpa trained
me to be like steel.

130
00:10:19,042 --> 00:10:21,292
Hey. You were driving
a car around, right?

131
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:24,292
So, does that mean that you're
from one of the big cities?

132
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,834
You got it.

133
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,792
Wow! Why don't you
come to my house with me

134
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,334
and I'll cook you some lunch.

135
00:10:29,417 --> 00:10:31,417
 You can tell me all
about the city you're from!

136
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,250
Come on!

137
00:10:32,334 --> 00:10:33,750
Hold on! Just a second!

138
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:36,792
 It looks like
the Dragon Ball

139
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,250
is right down the road!

140
00:10:38,334 --> 00:10:41,292
Maybe it's at
this little kid's house!

141
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,709
I think it's safe to assume

142
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:48,250
we're having fish for lunch.

143
00:10:48,334 --> 00:10:50,834
Well, alright!
So what's on the agenda?

144
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:53,209
Well, we can have
a bite to eat and talk,

145
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:54,542
then play together.

146
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,250
Now look.

147
00:10:56,334 --> 00:10:58,000
If you think we're going to
do anything improper,

148
00:10:58,084 --> 00:10:59,209
you can forget it!

149
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:01,584
Improper?
What does that mean?

150
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:03,792
Oh, nevermind.

151
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,292
I guess Grandpa hasn't

152
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:06,834
told him about that yet!

153
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:09,750
This kid's so innocent
that he's adorable.

154
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:12,625
Golly. Girls sure are strange!

155
00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:14,500
Well anyway, let's go.

156
00:11:14,584 --> 00:11:17,792
 Sounds good! I'll
just follow the giant fish.

157
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:22,834
So, kid.
What's your name anyway?

158
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:25,167
My name is Goku.
G. O. K. U.

159
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,834
 What's yours?

160
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:29,792
Uh... My name? Mine?

161
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,500
Uh huh.

162
00:11:31,584 --> 00:11:32,750
Bulma.

163
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:36,000
Hmm? Ha ha. That's funny!

164
00:11:36,084 --> 00:11:38,625
Hey, Goku's not
exactly normal, so there!

165
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:41,459
 Yeah, but it's
not as weird as yours!

166
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,209
Hey, you be quiet!

167
00:11:44,292 --> 00:11:46,250
Bulma happens to be
very elegant!

168
00:11:46,334 --> 00:11:49,167
It's a lot better than Goku!
That's for sure!

169
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,625
Hmph!

170
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:04,375
 Wow!
That's a nice little place

171
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:05,667
you've got there, kid!

172
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,417
 Gee, thanks!
Just wait here one second.

173
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:11,584
Huh?

174
00:12:14,542 --> 00:12:15,834
Listen.

175
00:12:15,917 --> 00:12:17,042
What's up?

176
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,292
Grandpa's trying
to talk to me.

177
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:22,292
But Goku,
I don't hear anyone ta...

178
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:26,750
Oh my goodness!
It's a Dragon Ball!

179
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:32,209
Hey! Give me
my grandpa back now!

180
00:12:32,292 --> 00:12:35,250
Your grandpa? You mean this?

181
00:12:35,334 --> 00:12:37,875
Yeah! This is the
only thing that my grandpa

182
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:39,625
gave me to remember him by.

183
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:42,167
Nobody can touch it but me.

184
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,042
 Look!
Look what it's doing.

185
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:46,709
I think Grandpa's
trying to talk to me.

186
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:48,584
What do you think he's saying?

187
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:51,959
I hate to do this, but I
don't really have a choice!

188
00:12:52,042 --> 00:12:53,000
See!

189
00:12:53,084 --> 00:12:54,875
What?!
You've got to be kidding!

190
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,334
You've got
two Grandpas! No way!

191
00:12:57,417 --> 00:13:00,875
They're not Grandpas.
They're called Dragon Balls.

192
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,584
You sure about that?

193
00:13:02,667 --> 00:13:04,584
Definitely. I'm positive.

194
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:06,167
Your ball started
glowing because it was

195
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,417
reacting to
the two that I have.

196
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,667
Look. Put yours down.

197
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,917
 Well... okay.
But just for a second.

198
00:13:14,542 --> 00:13:15,834
 Oh.

199
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:18,292
Pretty cool, huh?

200
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:21,334
Yeah, these gems have the
power to do great things!

201
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:23,667
And not so great!
Let's just say if a bad person

202
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,000
got ahold of these balls,

203
00:13:25,084 --> 00:13:27,125
he could really
wreak some havoc!

204
00:13:27,209 --> 00:13:29,625
Well what do
these things do?

205
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:32,042
Sure you want to know?

206
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,667
Yeah!

207
00:13:34,834 --> 00:13:36,375
M'kay...

208
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:41,375
Ah, there it is!

209
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:43,375
 It's awfully
dark in there, Sire!

210
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:45,334
 Shut up, Shu!

211
00:13:48,917 --> 00:13:51,250
 Ahh...!

212
00:13:51,334 --> 00:13:54,000
Come to Emperor Pilaf,
my precious! Yes!

213
00:13:56,417 --> 00:14:00,250
 Get off of me
you bone-head! Ewe!

214
00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:07,917
Uh! 

215
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,417
Well, enough of that.
I'm ready to make my wish!

216
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,584
-- Sir?
-- What?!

217
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:13,334
I hate to be the one
to break it to you,

218
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:15,292
but you can't make a wish
with just one ball,

219
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,125
you have to have
the others as well.

220
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:18,500
Mm! Huh?!

221
00:14:18,584 --> 00:14:20,417
 There are
seven Dragon Balls, Sire!

222
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,334
You have to unite
all seven of them

223
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:24,834
before the Dragon will
appear and grant your wish!

224
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:27,209
Hm... More searching.

225
00:14:27,292 --> 00:14:29,209
 But just imagine,
dear Emperor,

226
00:14:29,292 --> 00:14:31,375
that glorious day
when the seven balls are

227
00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:33,084
finally brought together!

228
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:36,042
A beautiful burst of
energy will light the sky,

229
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,292
and in a blazing
surge of fiery power,

230
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,375
the Eternal Dragon
will rise before you

231
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:43,334
for the sole purpose of
granting you a single wish.

232
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:45,209
Whatever it may be.

233
00:14:46,042 --> 00:14:48,084
Yes! Yes! I can see it!

234
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:49,625
Well, okay!

235
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:52,625
I guess I can handle
a little more searching.

236
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:53,959
Any wish I want, huh?

237
00:14:54,042 --> 00:14:57,709
Well then, I want to
rule the entire world!

238
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,625
 Wow! That's amazing!

239
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:04,459
You can wish for
whatever you want?

240
00:15:04,542 --> 00:15:05,709
And it will come true?!

241
00:15:05,792 --> 00:15:07,542
I wonder why
my grandpa didn't tell me

242
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:08,917
about any of this stuff!

243
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,417
He may not have
known about it, Goku.

244
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,834
Not many people do.

245
00:15:12,917 --> 00:15:14,625
The truth is,
you and I are some of

246
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:16,500
the few people in
the world that even know

247
00:15:16,584 --> 00:15:19,000
about the Dragon Balls
or the Dragon.

248
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,584
Don't get mine
mixed up with yours, okay?

249
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:23,209
Don't worry,
that's impossible.

250
00:15:23,292 --> 00:15:25,167
Each ball has a different
number of stars in it.

251
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,625
See. This one has five.

252
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:28,959
Oh, I get it.
Grandpa's ball has four stars.

253
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:30,625
Now you're catching on!

254
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,042
I can't believe that I already
have three of the balls!

255
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,959
If I keep this up,
I'll be able to wish for

256
00:15:36,042 --> 00:15:37,875
a boyfriend before
the end of the month!

257
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:39,917
This is so exciting!

258
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,750
You are going to let me
use your Dragon Ball

259
00:15:41,834 --> 00:15:43,250
so I can make
my wish, right?

260
00:15:43,334 --> 00:15:44,542
You can forget it!

261
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,792
Grandpa gave me this ball
to remember him by.

262
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,167
 And I'm not
going to hand it over,

263
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,667
just because you're a girl.

264
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,209
 But your
grandpa said to be as

265
00:15:51,292 --> 00:15:53,084
polite as possible to girls.

266
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:54,125
Mm-mmm.

267
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:55,250
Uh!

268
00:15:55,334 --> 00:15:58,292
Hey, I know what.
Look, I'll trade ya.

269
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,750
Uh...?

270
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:03,584
You let me have
your Dragon Ball,

271
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:05,667
and I'll let you
have a little peak.

272
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,459
What do I care about
seeing your dirty ol' fanny?

273
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:11,834
It is not dirty,
you rude little boy!

274
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:13,542
Well, shoot.
There's got to be a way.

275
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:14,834
The hunt must go on.

276
00:16:14,917 --> 00:16:16,917
Hey, I know!
Why don't you come with me?

277
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,167
We can be partners.
Whatd'ya say?

278
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,834
Oh, go hunt balls?

279
00:16:20,917 --> 00:16:22,375
 Sure, why not?

280
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:24,667
You would get to see so many
new things and learn so much.

281
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,625
Your grandpa would
be very proud of you.

282
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:28,292
Really?! You think
Grandpa would be

283
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,584
proud if I went?

284
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:30,959
Of course he would, kid.

285
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:32,875
Seeing his young
grandson that he raised

286
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,417
venture out into
the world all on his own.

287
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,292
 Learning all
about the great cities,

288
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,250
and crossing the desert,
and seeing the ocean!

289
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:42,084
Alright, that sounds
like a lot of fun.

290
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,375
I guess I'll go.

291
00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:46,209
This'll be great!
So we're partners?

292
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:49,209
Alright. But I still get
to keep my grandpa's ball.

293
00:16:49,292 --> 00:16:52,292
You drive a hard bargain,
but have it your way.

294
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:53,750
The little kid's stubborn,

295
00:16:53,834 --> 00:16:56,292
but he'll make a good body
guard until I make my wish.

296
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:59,625
I'll wish for the most perfect
boyfriend that ever lived!

297
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:04,000
 Well, here we go!
The start of a great adventure!

298
00:17:04,084 --> 00:17:06,500
Hey, Bulma! How do we
know where to start looking?

299
00:17:06,584 --> 00:17:07,750
The Dragon Balls
could be anywhere

300
00:17:07,834 --> 00:17:09,625
in the whole world, right?

301
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,750
Just who do you think
you're dealing with here, kid?

302
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:14,750
I'm no amateur.

303
00:17:15,542 --> 00:17:17,042
Look--check it out!

304
00:17:18,417 --> 00:17:19,875
Huh...?

305
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:21,459
 It's a special radar
that tracks the Dragon Balls.

306
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:23,000
Look. See these three dots?

307
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:24,459
These are our three balls.

308
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:26,334
And these are
the other Dragon Balls.

309
00:17:26,417 --> 00:17:28,542
It looks like the
closest ball is right here--

310
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,959
about 750 miles to the west.

311
00:17:31,042 --> 00:17:32,334
Is that far?

312
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:34,292
Let's just say that it's
out of our walking distance.

313
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,000
And since you destoyed my car,

314
00:17:36,084 --> 00:17:37,917
we'll be needing
a new set of wheels.

315
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,375
Hmm.

316
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,584
 Let's see now.
What am I in the mood for?

317
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:45,125
Ah! This one will
be fun for a while.

318
00:17:45,209 --> 00:17:47,709
Stand back, kid. Stay there.

319
00:17:53,917 --> 00:17:55,500
--Check it out!
--Whoa!

320
00:17:55,584 --> 00:17:57,875
Bulma! How did you do that?!

321
00:17:57,959 --> 00:18:00,292
You're some kind
of witch, aren't you?

322
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,834
 What? Nonsense.

323
00:18:01,917 --> 00:18:03,667
Witchcraft has
nothing to do with it.

324
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,667
Everyone in the city
has dyno-caps.

325
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,792
How could you
travel without them?

326
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:11,042
Hey! Will you knock it off?

327
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:14,167
Just hop on.
It won't bite you.

328
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,125
 I'm on.

329
00:18:15,209 --> 00:18:17,334
 Okay! Here we go!

330
00:18:17,417 --> 00:18:18,459
Ah, aaahhh!

331
00:18:18,542 --> 00:18:20,417
Neato! This thing
goes even faster

332
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,334
than I can run! Yep!

333
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:25,375
No duh, squirt.
Get with the program!

334
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:28,667
--
-- Huh?

335
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,084
 Weeee!

336
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:42,167
♪

337
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,459
 Chill out, Goku.

338
00:18:43,542 --> 00:18:45,459
You're squeezing
the life out of me!

339
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:46,834
 Oops, sorry!

340
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,000
 Just relax. I happen
to be an expert driver.

341
00:18:49,084 --> 00:18:50,584
I'm in total control...

342
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:52,875
--
--

343
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:57,625
 Ah! Wow!
That was great, Bulma!

344
00:18:57,709 --> 00:18:59,417
Let's go back and
do it again. C'mon!

345
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,959
That was so much fun.
Just one more time. Please!

346
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:05,125
 I almost lost it
big-time on that one.

347
00:19:05,209 --> 00:19:06,917
I need to be more careful!

348
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,959
Hm? Uh, oh!

349
00:19:09,042 --> 00:19:10,417
Uh, excuse me
a minute, Goku.

350
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,917
Time for a pit-stop.

351
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,584
Uh, okay. I'll come to.

352
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:14,917
Oh, no you won't!

353
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,959
Don't the words "pit-stop"
mean anything to you?

354
00:19:17,042 --> 00:19:18,292
Stay right there!

355
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,334
"Pit-stop"?
What does that mean?

356
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:23,000
 I need to pee,
you lame-brain!

357
00:19:23,084 --> 00:19:24,792
Huh? I don't get it.

358
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,792
Why can't she
just pee right here?

359
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:27,917
How strange.

360
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,709
Goku! Come here! Quick!

361
00:19:30,792 --> 00:19:33,334
 Huh? I sure wish
she'd make up her mind.

362
00:19:33,417 --> 00:19:34,917
Coming, Bulma!

363
00:19:41,709 --> 00:19:43,625
Who the heck are you, kiddo?

364
00:19:43,709 --> 00:19:44,917
My name's Goku.

365
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,500
Are... you a friend of Bulma's?

366
00:19:49,792 --> 00:19:51,917
Yeah, that's it!

367
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,709
As a matter of fact, we have
fancy dinner engagements

368
00:19:54,792 --> 00:19:57,917
but the reservations
are only for two!

369
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,459
So...

370
00:20:03,167 --> 00:20:05,084
Gosh! I think he was lying.

371
00:20:05,167 --> 00:20:07,000
You're a regular Einstein!

372
00:20:07,084 --> 00:20:08,709
See ya!

373
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,375
Hey, stop being
such a downer, baby!

374
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:15,250
I'm in the mood for
a happy meal!

375
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:20,709
Hey! Where are you
guys going, Bulma? Huh?

376
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:25,959
Don't just stand there,
idiot! Get! Me! Down!

377
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:28,625
Well gee, I don't
blame her for being upset,

378
00:20:28,709 --> 00:20:31,334
but she doesn't have to
go calling me names.

379
00:20:34,459 --> 00:20:35,417
I'd like to help her down,

380
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,584
but I really
don't know how to fly.

381
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:39,042
Hey! I've got it!

382
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:43,625
Let's see here.
How does this thing work?

383
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:46,167
Bulma was able to make it
fly a few minutes ago.

384
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,667
 Whoa! It's moving!

385
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,875
Come on, whatever you are!

386
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:51,334
I know you can
go faster than this!

387
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,334
We've got to get moving!
Bulma's in trouble!

388
00:20:57,834 --> 00:21:00,750
Goku! Please help me!

389
00:21:00,834 --> 00:21:02,084
 Hang on, Bulma!

390
00:21:03,209 --> 00:21:05,584
Yaaa!

391
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,250
Hang on.
Just a little further.

392
00:21:14,334 --> 00:21:15,709
Huh?

393
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:18,292
Goku, help!

394
00:21:24,167 --> 00:21:25,792
Boo!

395
00:21:26,584 --> 00:21:28,500
Power Pole extend!

396
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,209
Here! Take this
you mean ol' bully!

397
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,917
 Here! Bulma!

398
00:21:52,917 --> 00:21:54,459
Aaah...!

399
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,417
 Hm? Too bad.

400
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,250
I really don't
like to hurt anybody,

401
00:22:04,334 --> 00:22:06,417
but he gave me no choice.

402
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,250
 Goku!

403
00:22:08,334 --> 00:22:09,334
Huh?

404
00:22:09,417 --> 00:22:12,875
Aren't you going to help me?!

405
00:22:12,959 --> 00:22:16,667
Help! I'm having a bit
of a crisis up here.

406
00:22:17,834 --> 00:22:19,459
Be right there, Bulma!

407
00:22:19,542 --> 00:22:21,667
 As Goku and
Bulma continue their quest

408
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,334
what will befall them next?

409
00:22:23,417 --> 00:22:25,792
The race is on
as both good and evil forces

410
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,584
plot a crash course!

411
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:29,792
Who will be the first
to unlock the mystery

412
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:32,625
of the seven magic
Dragon Balls?
