1
00:02:07,584 --> 00:02:10,667
 With only two
more Dragon Balls left to find,

2
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,375
our heroes, Goku and Bulma
are heading into very dangerous

3
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:17,834
territory as they
continue their search.

4
00:02:17,917 --> 00:02:20,834
Joining them in their quest
is Oolong, the perverse pig

5
00:02:20,917 --> 00:02:23,625
who can change his
appearance at will.

6
00:02:28,542 --> 00:02:30,459
 It was a good idea
to travel down this river.

7
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:32,750
We're making awesome time!

8
00:02:32,834 --> 00:02:33,792
That's great!

9
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,750
But why is Oolong
coming with us?

10
00:02:35,834 --> 00:02:38,000
I think she's got
a thing for me, kid!

11
00:02:38,084 --> 00:02:40,125
I thought Oolong's
special powers might come

12
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:42,625
in handy. That's why
he's coming along.

13
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:44,042
Hey, what do you mean?!

14
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,959
Are you tryin' to
say I'm not your type?

15
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:49,750
Exactly! I'm looking for
tall, dark, and handsome!

16
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,375
Just give it
time, honey!

17
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:54,250
You'll see, "I'm the man"!

18
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:00,084
Hey, back off kid!
I ain't that kinda pig!

19
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:01,709
You were right!
You are a man!

20
00:03:01,792 --> 00:03:03,959
Of course I'm
a man, you imbecile!

21
00:03:04,042 --> 00:03:06,292
What more do you want?
I'll take a polygraph,

22
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:10,000
give a blood sample, just
don't ever do that again!

23
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,667
Hey Bulma,
how much further?

24
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,875
Well, we should
almost be there by now.

25
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,292
This map will tell us exactly.

26
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:36,334
We've been driving
forever already!

27
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:38,584
Where in the world
are we going??

28
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:41,625
We're going to a place
called "Fire Mountain".

29
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:43,125
Fire Mountain?!

30
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:45,834
Are you crazy?! There's no
way you're draggin' me anywhere

31
00:03:45,917 --> 00:03:46,959
near that place!

32
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,625
 What's so
scary about a mountain?

33
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:52,167
For starters, the place
is always on fire, and it's the

34
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,375
home of the terrible Ox-King!
Do you understand now?

35
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:56,875
That bad, huh?

36
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:57,917
 Mm-hmm.

37
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,292
 Relax, Oolong.

38
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:00,834
Goku's strong enough to
take care of some old "ox".

39
00:04:01,584 --> 00:04:03,000
 I don't
know about that.

40
00:04:03,084 --> 00:04:05,709
I've heard the Ox-King is the
strongest guy in the whole

41
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:08,750
world! They say he's over
ten feet tall and weighs

42
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:13,084
500 pounds. And he's always on
the prowl for anyone who might

43
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:17,042
try to climb up the mountain to
get to his castle. He carries a

44
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:20,125
giant battle axe, and let me
tell you, he knows how to use

45
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:23,375
it too! He's been terrorizing
the countryside for years,

46
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:26,834
and they say that if you meet
the Ox-King, there's only one

47
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:31,709
thing you can do: Run! 'Cause
if he catches you, you'll get

48
00:04:31,792 --> 00:04:33,500
a really "close shave"!

49
00:04:34,334 --> 00:04:35,792
You really heard that?

50
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,625
 Uh-huh!

51
00:04:38,042 --> 00:04:39,834
 Sounds like
the guy's not very happy.

52
00:04:39,917 --> 00:04:42,417
 Exactly!
He's radically unhappy!

53
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:47,209
Well, I'm outta here!

54
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,000
 Hey!

55
00:04:50,584 --> 00:04:52,500
 Don't worry
Bulma. I'll get him!

56
00:04:54,292 --> 00:04:55,084
Careful!

57
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,375
Ah, Sassa-fras'n school of fish!

58
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:05,584
Never did like school!

59
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:09,667
This kid's crazy!

60
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:15,000
I don't see him anywhere.
Where'd he go?

61
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:24,417
I lost him, Bulma!

62
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,584
Well, if you want to
catch a fish, you gotta use

63
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:29,375
the right kind of bait.

64
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:32,084
 Like this!

65
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:34,125
Do you think he'll bite?

66
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,834
If I know
Oolong, he will!

67
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,834
 I think
I've got a nibble.

68
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,000
Yeah! Grab him, Goku!

69
00:05:48,584 --> 00:05:50,834
Hey, whaddaya know,
he bit your shorts!

70
00:05:56,792 --> 00:05:58,209
Hey, why is all
the food gone?

71
00:05:58,292 --> 00:05:59,834
Did you make a pig of yourself?

72
00:05:59,917 --> 00:06:02,750
Unfortunate choice of words,
but the great outdoors

73
00:06:02,834 --> 00:06:04,334
do make me hungry.

74
00:06:04,417 --> 00:06:07,167
 Here, take this special
vitamin. It'll fill you up,

75
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,500
and give you strength!

76
00:06:08,584 --> 00:06:10,667
It doesn't look like much,
but I'll try it.

77
00:06:11,917 --> 00:06:13,917
 It's made from
all natural ingredients.

78
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,625
It's very good for you.

79
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,834
I just hope you
health nuts don't eat pork.

80
00:06:20,417 --> 00:06:22,459
 Hey, Bulma!
What about me?

81
00:06:22,542 --> 00:06:23,709
I'm hungry too!

82
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:25,292
Uh, that was
the last one.

83
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,209
See, kid?
It's my hoggish allure.

84
00:06:27,292 --> 00:06:28,667
I'm not your
average porker!

85
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,875
 Huh?!

86
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,875
That's great!
We're outta gas!

87
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:41,042
Is that sorta like
being out of food?

88
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,792
Very good, that's exactly
what it's like Goku.

89
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,084
Then let's just
feed the boat.

90
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:48,750
Hey, Oolong, can you
change into a tank of gas?

91
00:06:48,834 --> 00:06:50,917
Against union rules, honey!

92
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,959
Besides, I'd get all used up.

93
00:06:53,042 --> 00:06:56,084
 Then how about a paddle
just to help us get to shore?

94
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:58,292
 I'd be honored
to be "handled" by a

95
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,625
girl like you, Bulma.

96
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:01,459
Showtime!

97
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:07,667
Just go like this in the water,
and we'll move.

98
00:07:08,792 --> 00:07:10,584
Wow, that's really neat!

99
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:12,709
 Ha ha ha, yeah!

100
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:20,250
 Hey! Watch
the water in the mouth,

101
00:07:20,334 --> 00:07:22,167
you muscle-bound midget!

102
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,500
I gotta go, Bulma!

103
00:07:26,584 --> 00:07:28,375
 Don't be gone long!

104
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:33,084
 Goku!
Really, that kid...

105
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:34,417
Well, it's too
bad we couldn't make

106
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,917
it to Fire Mountain!

107
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,542
I hate to disappoint you,
Oolong,

108
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,834
but we're
practically there already.

109
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,542
But it's
crazy to go there!

110
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,375
It's way too dangerous!

111
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:49,792
My... my Dyno Caps!
They're missing!

112
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,625
No! Aah! We're trapped in
a wasteland with no way

113
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:54,334
to get out!

114
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,750
I think you took our Dyno Caps,
just like you stole our lunch,

115
00:07:57,834 --> 00:07:59,209
you little porker!

116
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:02,417
Hey! I resent
being called little!

117
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:06,875
What's the matter?
Why are you so upset?

118
00:08:07,542 --> 00:08:10,167
You don't understand!
Without the Dyno-Caps

119
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:14,542
we're stuck here! No boats!
No bikes! Nothing! Nada!

120
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:15,459
But...

121
00:08:18,334 --> 00:08:20,459
Why can't you just walk, Bulma?

122
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:21,375
That's easy for you to say!

123
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,500
You can ride the Flying Nimbus!

124
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,250
So long, suckers!

125
00:08:27,334 --> 00:08:29,292
Well, why don't you just
have Oolong change into a

126
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,000
motorbike, and then
ride him outta here?

127
00:08:32,084 --> 00:08:33,834
 Oh! That's a
great idea, Goku.

128
00:08:33,917 --> 00:08:35,334
I'm glad I thought of it!

129
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:37,792
Hey! Oolong, dear?

130
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,167
Huh?

131
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,042
Ahh! He ditched us!

132
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,750
 Don't worry,
Bulma. I'll go get him!

133
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:47,875
 Hey, Oolong
where are you?

134
00:08:48,334 --> 00:08:50,875
Come out, come out
wherever you are!

135
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:53,625
You can't hide forever!

136
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:55,792
Hey, oh, Oolong!

137
00:08:56,292 --> 00:08:59,084
If you come out I'll give
you a nice juicy pail of slop!

138
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,750
 If he thinks I'm
dumb enough to fall for the

139
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,375
old 'juicy pail of
slop' routine, then he's

140
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:07,417
even dumber than I thought!

141
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,959
There's no sign of
him anywhere, Bulma.

142
00:09:13,042 --> 00:09:16,500
Oh! I knew I
couldn't trust him!

143
00:09:16,584 --> 00:09:19,667
Piggy Piggy Piggy Piggy!

144
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,042
Piggy Piggy Piggy!

145
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,334
 Piggy Piggy!

146
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,250
 What's wrong
with my poor stomach?!

147
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:34,834
Woah! Oh, oh, I'm gonna blow!

148
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,042
Hey! Hey, Oolong!
What's the matter, little piggy?

149
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,792
You know that
vitamin I gave you?

150
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:49,334
It's really a pill that makes
you have to go "squatty potty"

151
00:09:49,417 --> 00:09:51,709
anytime someone makes
the "Piggy" sound!

152
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:54,792
 You're
not going anywhere!

153
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:57,459
Oh, that's perfect!

154
00:09:57,542 --> 00:09:59,709
Huh, guess I've
got you under my power

155
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:01,417
now, little piggy!

156
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,625
 What's with you?

157
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:09,667
You're a witch!

158
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,000
You cast a spell
on Oolong, admit it!

159
00:10:12,084 --> 00:10:14,459
Oh Goku,
don't be so naive!

160
00:10:14,542 --> 00:10:17,042
If I were a witch I wouldn't
need the Dragon Balls to

161
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:20,000
grant my wishes. That pill
was just a little bit of science

162
00:10:20,084 --> 00:10:21,709
to control cowards like--

163
00:10:21,792 --> 00:10:23,084
 Cheap shot!

164
00:10:23,542 --> 00:10:27,375
Lucky for me I brought
some toilet paper along.

165
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:30,292
So, I trust my little
pill will keep you in line?

166
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,500
Yeah...

167
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,875
Yeah, I'll be "in line"
to get in the bathroom,

168
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:37,292
that's for sure!

169
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,042
I'll bet this kind of
stuff wouldn't happen

170
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,500
if you acted nicer!

171
00:10:40,584 --> 00:10:42,500
I can still
take ya, kid!

172
00:10:42,584 --> 00:10:46,584
Oh? Piggy
piggy piggy! Piggy!

173
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:53,667
I'll get you for this!

174
00:10:56,792 --> 00:10:59,459
Well, I need my
motorcycle now, Oolong!

175
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,750
You lazy...

176
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,417
Huh? Hey, this
isn't exactly what

177
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,292
I had in mind, Oolong!

178
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,917
Me either, toots.

179
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,417
Oh well. Let's go.

180
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:21,459
Can't you do
anything right?!

181
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:23,500
What do we do now, pork chop?

182
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:26,209
Look, you amazon!

183
00:11:26,292 --> 00:11:28,375
Do you think it's fun being
squashed to the ground

184
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:30,167
by a horse like you?!

185
00:11:31,834 --> 00:11:33,292
So that's the
thanks I get.

186
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,542
What's the use anyway?

187
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,584
I can only hold a new
shape for five minutes,

188
00:11:36,667 --> 00:11:37,584
then--poof!

189
00:11:39,292 --> 00:11:41,292
Everyone thinks
shape-changing makes you

190
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:44,500
stronger that you really are,
but it don't. I couldn't even

191
00:11:44,584 --> 00:11:46,834
carry you outta
here, if I wanted to.

192
00:11:46,917 --> 00:11:49,084
But, I've got another idea.

193
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:54,084
Here, how's this, Bulma?

194
00:11:55,084 --> 00:11:57,750
 Put me on and then
only one of us has to walk!

195
00:11:57,834 --> 00:12:01,959
You pervert! Take that!

196
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:09,209
Next time, maybe you
should try being her hat!

197
00:12:27,292 --> 00:12:29,334
 Continuing
their journey on foot,

198
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:32,459
Bulma, Oolong, and
Goku press on into the

199
00:12:32,542 --> 00:12:36,459
uncharted,
unexplored. and uncool.

200
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,500
I gave up riding my
cloud to walk with you two,

201
00:12:43,584 --> 00:12:44,875
now try and keep up!

202
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,167
 Just remember:
you're not a city kid, Goku.

203
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,459
You're used to the
wilderness, but I'm not!

204
00:12:49,542 --> 00:12:51,125
I should be pampered!

205
00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:53,417
My gosh, look
at this place!

206
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,000
 Yeah,
something's not right.

207
00:12:56,084 --> 00:12:58,417
I keep getting the
feeling we're being watched.

208
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,292
It's giving me the creeps!

209
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:03,417
I can't stand
it! I'm going crazy!

210
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,542
Are you giving up?

211
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:09,500
 No! Yes...
Maybe? I don't know!

212
00:13:11,042 --> 00:13:13,417
I want a bath!
I need air-conditioning!

213
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,709
I don't want to be stranded
in the desert without a

214
00:13:15,792 --> 00:13:17,875
boyfriend or my
Dyno-Caps anymore!

215
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:19,667
Her passion for
self-centeredness

216
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,167
inspires even me.

217
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,542
You sure are strange,
Oolong.

218
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:26,334
 Ahh, shade.
Nap-time...

219
00:13:26,417 --> 00:13:28,875
I say we just let
her rest for a while.

220
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,584
Suits me!

221
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:34,750
I sure am hungry. Uhh.

222
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:40,500
 Victims.

223
00:13:45,084 --> 00:13:48,250
 Yamcha! Yamcha!

224
00:13:48,334 --> 00:13:49,792
Victims! Woo hoo!

225
00:13:51,417 --> 00:13:54,417
Well. it's about time.

226
00:14:00,417 --> 00:14:03,375
 We've had quite a dry
spell since we hijacked that

227
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:05,209
caravan, haven't we, Puar?

228
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:06,917
They're right down there,
Yamcha.

229
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,209
Can you see them?
Can you see them?

230
00:14:09,292 --> 00:14:11,917
 Only two? No problem.

231
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,584
 I'm starving over here!

232
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:18,125
I'm gonna go
find us some food.

233
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,292
Do you like bacon?

234
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,834
What are
you, brain dead?!

235
00:14:23,542 --> 00:14:25,834
 I think I
hear something.

236
00:14:31,792 --> 00:14:34,084
 What is it?

237
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:35,792
It ain't no camel!

238
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:02,542
Greetings.

239
00:15:08,334 --> 00:15:09,417
I am Yamcha.

240
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,959
I am master of the
land you trespass upon.

241
00:15:12,042 --> 00:15:14,542
It's my land, too!

242
00:15:15,334 --> 00:15:17,625
You needn't fear me.
Just hand over your money and

243
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:21,084
any Dyno-Caps you may have and
I will let you pass in peace.

244
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:23,042
You're Puar!

245
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,459
We went to
shape-shifting acadamy together.

246
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:26,500
 I remember!

247
00:15:26,584 --> 00:15:28,084
And you were a
loud-mouthed bully!

248
00:15:28,167 --> 00:15:30,750
He always picked on me and stole
my lunch money, because I was

249
00:15:30,834 --> 00:15:32,250
smaller than him!

250
00:15:33,042 --> 00:15:35,250
I'd say the tables
have turned, my friend.

251
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,417
How does it feel to
face someone bigger

252
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,042
than yourself, little piglet?

253
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,417
This guy looks pretty tough,
kid.

254
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,709
Think you can take him?

255
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:43,542
It's just like in the old days.

256
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:48,167
The swine still hides behind
someone whenever he's afraid!

257
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,625
Not much courage, huh?

258
00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:50,709
That's right!

259
00:15:50,792 --> 00:15:53,834
Not an ounce of
courage on that porker!

260
00:15:53,917 --> 00:15:57,959
Puar, if I ever
get my hands on you...

261
00:15:58,042 --> 00:15:59,625
Sounds like you
haven't changed much over

262
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,459
the years, Oolong.

263
00:16:01,542 --> 00:16:03,459
Okay boys, enough talk.

264
00:16:03,542 --> 00:16:07,084
Either hand over your goods
or prepare to fight me.

265
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:11,375
Just how strong
are you Goku?

266
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:12,709
I'm super strong.

267
00:16:12,792 --> 00:16:14,042
All right, big shot!

268
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,000
The bigger you are
the harder you fall!

269
00:16:16,084 --> 00:16:19,167
You may think you're looking at
an easy haul here, but my man

270
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,334
will slap you two silly before
it's all said and done!

271
00:16:26,334 --> 00:16:27,959
 Prepare to
defend yourself.

272
00:16:29,292 --> 00:16:31,042
 Make pork chops
out of him, Yamcha!

273
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,917
He can't talk to you like that!

274
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,709
 Just a second.

275
00:16:34,792 --> 00:16:36,709
All right! Destroy
'em little buddy!

276
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:38,917
Oolong, why should I
want to destroy this guy?

277
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,042
Did he hurt somebody?

278
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,667
 Haven't you
been listening, kid?

279
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,042
That sword isn't made
outta rubber you know.

280
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,834
He plans to kill us!

281
00:16:46,917 --> 00:16:48,959
 I don't want to fight
you, but if I have to defend

282
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:51,042
my friends, I will!

283
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,292
I admire your bravery, kid.

284
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,292
Is it bravery or stupidity?

285
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,542
Geez, I thought
it was an earthquake!

286
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:13,875
Hyaah!

287
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:16,792
Hi-ya!

288
00:17:25,792 --> 00:17:27,917
Hyaah!

289
00:17:44,834 --> 00:17:46,542
Power Pole, extend!

290
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,125
Unbelievable!

291
00:17:55,209 --> 00:17:56,250
Believe it!

292
00:17:56,334 --> 00:17:57,959
The kid's winning
this one, isn't he?!

293
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,667
You have great power for
a little one, don't you?

294
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,042
 Thank you.
My Grandpa trained me.

295
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,417
 Ahh. The pole.
the extending Power Pole.

296
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,167
Only one man could
have given that to you.

297
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,750
Who is this
grandfather of yours?

298
00:18:13,834 --> 00:18:15,917
His name was Gohan.

299
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,792
And he died a long time ago.

300
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,292
I knew of him.
But even with your magic pole

301
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,292
and all that he
may have taught you,

302
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:26,709
I'm afraid you are
still no match for me.

303
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:28,459
 I will
have that pole's power.

304
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:31,625
Give it to me or prepare
to fight to the death!

305
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,417
Uh-oh.
We're lunch meat now!

306
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,542
I'm starving!

307
00:18:41,542 --> 00:18:45,334
You're not the only one
with special powers, kid.

308
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:48,917
Watch this!

309
00:18:52,584 --> 00:18:54,500
Wolf Fang Fist!

310
00:18:56,917 --> 00:19:00,084
--
--

311
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,042
 Guess we
won't need a headstone.

312
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:29,500
Why do I always
back the loser?

313
00:19:29,584 --> 00:19:31,792
Why does it always
have to happen this way??

314
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,667
Now he'll come for me!

315
00:19:34,834 --> 00:19:36,542
 Gee, I'd love to
stay and fight with you,

316
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:37,584
but I gotta fly!

317
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:43,209
Now's your chance, Puar!

318
00:19:43,292 --> 00:19:44,000
Get him!

319
00:19:44,084 --> 00:19:46,167
Right. With pleasure!

320
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,084
You mangy mongrel!

321
00:19:53,167 --> 00:19:55,209
What'dya go and do that for?

322
00:19:55,292 --> 00:19:58,000
I owed you one, Oolong!

323
00:19:58,084 --> 00:20:01,667
 Now, my worthless
adversary, either hand over what

324
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,042
you have or join your friend.

325
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,792
That's a choice, huh?

326
00:20:06,334 --> 00:20:09,334
There's absolutely nothing
worse than getting ripped off.

327
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:10,500
 Make it snappy, pig.

328
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,750
My patience with
you is wearing thin.

329
00:20:16,792 --> 00:20:19,209
Gotta get some food...

330
00:20:19,292 --> 00:20:19,959
 Thank you!

331
00:20:20,042 --> 00:20:21,167
 Hold It!

332
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,375
Right now, I've had just
about enough of you!

333
00:20:24,084 --> 00:20:25,709
If you've truly had enough, kid.

334
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:27,875
go back to sleep
amongst the rubble and

335
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:30,292
don't provoke me again.

336
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:34,917
Come on. I'm just
getting warmed up, you know.

337
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:56,459
That's it, kid!

338
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:03,167
Oh boy, I think I'm
gonna die if I don't get

339
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,417
something to eat.

340
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,250
Why're you just
standing there Goku?

341
00:21:06,334 --> 00:21:07,167
Do something!

342
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,959
Gee whiz, you guys.

343
00:21:13,042 --> 00:21:14,584
What's all the screaming about?

344
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,459
 She's gorgeous!

345
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,125
Master, you okay?

346
00:21:36,209 --> 00:21:39,375
Puar, you know I have
trouble around beautiful women!

347
00:21:39,459 --> 00:21:40,334
I know.

348
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:49,500
Well, I guess we put
them on the run, didn't we?

349
00:21:49,584 --> 00:21:51,500
Hey, you guys,
who was that hunk?

350
00:21:51,584 --> 00:21:53,625
He looked absolutely dreamy!

351
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,125
Oh, wow!

352
00:21:58,209 --> 00:21:59,625
Can we eat now?

353
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:05,084
 Meanwhile,
back in Yamcha's hideout.

354
00:22:05,167 --> 00:22:08,417
 A warrior toppled
by a girl is humiliating!

355
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,000
Yamcha, she had
nothing to do with it.

356
00:22:11,084 --> 00:22:13,000
You just tripped!

357
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:18,292
That's a lie, Puar!
I froze when I saw her.

358
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:21,000
But I will overcome
my fear of women.

359
00:22:21,084 --> 00:22:24,834
Those fools have not
heard the last of Yamcha!

360
00:22:24,917 --> 00:22:27,000
 It would seem that
our heroes haven't seen the last

361
00:22:27,084 --> 00:22:30,709
of Yamcha, the desert
bandit. Join us again for the

362
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:33,084
next episode of Dragon Ball!
