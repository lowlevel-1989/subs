1
00:02:48,499 --> 00:02:50,499
Yahoo.

2
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,420
- Bull's-eye.
- You bet, Dad.

3
00:03:15,624 --> 00:03:17,305
You go straight home.

4
00:03:23,145 --> 00:03:24,986
Bombs away.

5
00:03:35,428 --> 00:03:37,788
Sayonara, sucker.

6
00:05:43,489 --> 00:05:46,650
No preservatives, just pure water.

7
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,290
Cool, clear water.

8
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,091
Step up, schmuck, get
some dealing done.

9
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:54,291
H20, that's my go.

10
00:05:54,651 --> 00:05:58,652
Don't you understand? This is
water. You can't live without it.

11
00:06:02,812 --> 00:06:05,173
What's a little fallout, huh?

12
00:06:24,776 --> 00:06:26,416
You get a sack of grain

13
00:06:26,696 --> 00:06:29,017
or a woman for 2 hours.

14
00:06:36,818 --> 00:06:38,978
- What are you trading?
- I'm looking for someone.

15
00:06:39,218 --> 00:06:40,539
Are you trading or not?

16
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:42,219
He had a team of camels.

17
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:44,789
People come here to trade, make a

18
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,380
little profit, do
a little business.

19
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,060
If you've nothing to trade,
you've no business here.

20
00:06:51,221 --> 00:06:52,301
An hour inside.

21
00:06:52,661 --> 00:06:53,661
Next.

22
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:55,661
I got skills I can trade.

23
00:06:56,381 --> 00:06:58,382
Sorry. The brothel's full.

24
00:07:16,865 --> 00:07:18,185
One hour.

25
00:07:18,425 --> 00:07:19,507
And if you find him?

26
00:07:19,508 --> 00:07:21,426
I'll ask him to
return what's mine.

27
00:07:21,746 --> 00:07:24,426
And he'll be desperate
to clear his conscience.

28
00:07:24,706 --> 00:07:25,706
He will be.

29
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:27,907
You that good?

30
00:07:30,427 --> 00:07:33,268
Perhaps you have something
to trade after all.

31
00:07:33,588 --> 00:07:34,748
Keep talking.

32
00:07:35,428 --> 00:07:37,588
24 hours of your life.

33
00:07:38,108 --> 00:07:40,789
In return, you'll get
back what was stolen.

34
00:07:41,429 --> 00:07:42,949
Sounds like a bargain.

35
00:07:43,269 --> 00:07:47,390
It's not. Let's talk. Come inside.

36
00:08:01,672 --> 00:08:04,153
Leave your weapons
here. It's the law.

37
00:09:37,408 --> 00:09:41,889
Remember, this is the vehicle
that sent Detroit broke.

38
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,410
Where did you get these animals?

39
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:48,610
The glorious dromedary.
The ship of the desert.

40
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,485
They got independent
suspension power

41
00:09:51,486 --> 00:09:53,771
steering and no emission control.

42
00:09:54,091 --> 00:09:55,532
Ride them away now.

43
00:11:15,705 --> 00:11:17,025
A warrior, Aunty.

44
00:11:17,865 --> 00:11:20,866
Lost everything.
Looking for a deal.

45
00:11:25,187 --> 00:11:27,387
But he's just a raggedy man.

46
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:29,707
He's quick.

47
00:11:30,468 --> 00:11:31,508
Ironbar...

48
00:11:31,828 --> 00:11:33,308
can he do it?

49
00:11:34,548 --> 00:11:35,588
Maybe.

50
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,390
What did you do before this?

51
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,870
I was a cop, a driver.

52
00:11:49,911 --> 00:11:51,831
But how the world turns.

53
00:11:52,071 --> 00:11:54,752
One day cock of the walk,
next, a feather duster.

54
00:11:55,072 --> 00:11:57,912
Play something tragic, Ton Ton.

55
00:12:03,193 --> 00:12:04,833
Do you know who I was?

56
00:12:05,593 --> 00:12:06,754
Nobody.

57
00:12:07,434 --> 00:12:10,754
Except on the day after,
I was still alive.

58
00:12:11,754 --> 00:12:14,235
This nobody had a
chance to be somebody.

59
00:12:16,115 --> 00:12:20,076
So much for history.
Anyway... Water? Fruit?

60
00:13:09,964 --> 00:13:13,165
Congratulations. You're the
first to survive the audition.

61
00:13:20,686 --> 00:13:21,846
Drink.

62
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,447
It's okay.

63
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:37,449
Come with me.

64
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:44,010
Look around. All this I built.

65
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:48,211
Up to my armpits
in blood and shit.

66
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,771
Where there was desert,
now there's a town.

67
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,532
Where there was
robbery, there's trade.

68
00:13:55,372 --> 00:13:58,212
Where there was despair,
now there's hope.

69
00:13:58,732 --> 00:14:00,213
It's civilisation.

70
00:14:00,933 --> 00:14:03,213
I'll do anything to protect it.

71
00:14:05,974 --> 00:14:09,414
Today it's necessary to
kill a man. What do you say?

72
00:14:11,615 --> 00:14:12,775
What do you pay?

73
00:14:13,735 --> 00:14:18,216
I'll re-equip you... vehicles,
animals. Fuel, if you want.

74
00:14:18,496 --> 00:14:20,016
It's a generous offer.

75
00:14:20,176 --> 00:14:23,417
Why me? You've got warriors,
weapons. Give the order.

76
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:26,497
We are dealing with
subtleties here.

77
00:14:26,937 --> 00:14:29,258
This is no enemy.
It's almost family.

78
00:14:29,898 --> 00:14:31,738
I see, real civilised.

79
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:36,099
The reasons don't concern you,
just the conditions. Deal?

80
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:41,580
First, no one knows
you're working for Aunty.

81
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,100
You hit him, you go.

82
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,781
Second, it's a fair fight.

83
00:14:47,101 --> 00:14:49,461
And third, it's to the death.

84
00:14:52,622 --> 00:14:53,942
Who's the bunny?

85
00:15:29,948 --> 00:15:33,548
We call it Underworld. It's
where Bartertown gets its energy.

86
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:35,669
Oil, natural gas?

87
00:15:35,989 --> 00:15:37,349
Pigs.

88
00:15:37,949 --> 00:15:39,589
Pigs like those?

89
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:43,150
- Bullshit.
- Pigshit.

90
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:47,511
Pigshit. The lights, the
motors, the vehicles...

91
00:15:47,831 --> 00:15:51,351
all run by a high-powered
gas called methane.

92
00:15:52,192 --> 00:15:54,672
Methane comes from pigshit.

93
00:15:56,192 --> 00:15:58,833
Have a look. Tell me what you see.

94
00:16:01,073 --> 00:16:04,194
I see a big guy giving a
little guy a piggy back.

95
00:16:04,914 --> 00:16:07,354
MasterBlaster. They're a unit.

96
00:16:07,554 --> 00:16:09,635
They even share the same name.

97
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:13,715
The little one is called
Master. He's the brains.

98
00:16:14,035 --> 00:16:16,036
He runs Underworld.

99
00:16:16,556 --> 00:16:20,196
The other one is
Blaster. He's the muscle.

100
00:16:20,756 --> 00:16:23,237
Together they can
be very powerful.

101
00:16:26,037 --> 00:16:28,238
They are also arrogant.

102
00:16:29,158 --> 00:16:32,558
We want to keep the
brain, dump the body.

103
00:16:32,838 --> 00:16:34,679
He's big. Is he good?

104
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:38,559
He can beat most
men with his breath.

105
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:41,520
I want a closer look at
him. How do I get in there?

106
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,840
- It's a factory. Ask for work.
- I know nothing about methane.

107
00:16:46,081 --> 00:16:48,001
You can shovel shit, can't you?

108
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:37,289
Hey, you.

109
00:17:37,969 --> 00:17:39,290
Let's talk.

110
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,319
Here, free man,
come help a convict.

111
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,331
You don't want to end up like me.

112
00:17:47,771 --> 00:17:49,331
How long are you in for?

113
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,492
The big one. Life.

114
00:17:53,012 --> 00:17:54,052
For killing a pig?

115
00:17:54,492 --> 00:17:56,492
I had to feed the kids.

116
00:17:56,813 --> 00:18:00,813
Doesn't worry me. Down here
life's two, three years.

117
00:18:14,335 --> 00:18:17,696
Where is that bum
mechanic Blackfinger?

118
00:18:28,698 --> 00:18:30,538
We got a real problem.

119
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,299
Twelve pounds of
dynamite set to blow.

120
00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:37,019
You expert. Disarm.

121
00:18:50,742 --> 00:18:53,110
It's a class Job.
One mistake, it'll

122
00:18:53,111 --> 00:18:55,222
blow the crap out of this place.

123
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:56,502
Literally.

124
00:18:56,663 --> 00:18:58,063
Think what to do.

125
00:19:00,703 --> 00:19:04,384
Now... the dynamite is connected
to the timing device...

126
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:07,744
which is connected to the
switch, which I can't find...

127
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:11,025
which is connected to the...

128
00:19:11,465 --> 00:19:12,465
battery.

129
00:19:12,865 --> 00:19:14,266
I'll disconnect the battery.

130
00:19:14,506 --> 00:19:16,026
I wouldn't do that.

131
00:19:18,426 --> 00:19:19,747
Who you?

132
00:19:20,266 --> 00:19:21,266
Me Max.

133
00:19:21,267 --> 00:19:22,267
You smart.

134
00:19:22,587 --> 00:19:23,947
That's my vehicle.

135
00:19:24,187 --> 00:19:25,267
Disarm.

136
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:26,788
How much?

137
00:19:27,108 --> 00:19:29,428
No trade. Do.

138
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:32,588
Fetch.

139
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:41,390
Me order. Me Master.

140
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,191
Me run Bartertown.

141
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,631
That's why you live in shit.

142
00:19:46,951 --> 00:19:48,951
Not shit. Energy.

143
00:19:49,632 --> 00:19:52,272
Call it what you like, it
still smells like shit.

144
00:19:52,632 --> 00:19:56,793
Not shit. Energy.
No energy, no town.

145
00:19:57,233 --> 00:19:59,393
Me King Arab.

146
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:01,474
Sure. Me, fairy princess.

147
00:20:01,874 --> 00:20:03,634
Embargo, on.

148
00:20:23,917 --> 00:20:26,798
Embargo on. Main valve off.

149
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,081
4, 3, 2...

150
00:20:45,921 --> 00:20:47,601
For God's sake, what now?

151
00:20:48,441 --> 00:20:50,762
Who run Bartertown?

152
00:20:51,282 --> 00:20:53,922
Damn it. I told you,
no more embargos.

153
00:20:56,563 --> 00:20:57,563
More, Blaster.

154
00:21:05,204 --> 00:21:06,604
Who run Bartertown?

155
00:21:10,285 --> 00:21:13,286
Who run Bartertown?

156
00:21:13,966 --> 00:21:15,606
You know who.

157
00:21:16,126 --> 00:21:17,286
Say.

158
00:21:18,446 --> 00:21:19,967
MasterBlaster.

159
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:22,967
Say loud.

160
00:21:25,688 --> 00:21:26,968
MasterBlaster.

161
00:21:27,968 --> 00:21:30,449
MasterBlaster what?

162
00:21:32,969 --> 00:21:35,809
MasterBlaster runs Bartertown.

163
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,650
Louder.

164
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:41,650
MasterBlaster runs Bartertown.

165
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,331
Lift embargo.

166
00:22:11,575 --> 00:22:13,696
You want foot in face?

167
00:22:15,216 --> 00:22:16,696
Disarm.

168
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,537
Good boy.

169
00:22:55,543 --> 00:22:56,543
Over here, Blaster.

170
00:23:25,788 --> 00:23:28,268
- What are you laying for?
- Nothing.

171
00:23:28,628 --> 00:23:30,069
- Who are you?
- Nobody.

172
00:23:30,269 --> 00:23:33,949
No, mister, I can feel
it. The dice are rolling.

173
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:43,791
I want my camels, my vehicle,
food, water, methane.

174
00:23:45,911 --> 00:23:46,911
Deal.

175
00:23:46,991 --> 00:23:49,272
You said a fair fight.
What does that mean?

176
00:23:49,472 --> 00:23:51,632
As provided by law.

177
00:23:52,152 --> 00:23:53,313
Thunderdome.

178
00:23:57,633 --> 00:24:02,154
Two men, hand to hand. No
jury, no appeal, no parole.

179
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:04,474
Two men enter, one man leaves.

180
00:24:06,475 --> 00:24:07,795
Weapons?

181
00:24:07,995 --> 00:24:11,156
Anything's possible.
Chance decides.

182
00:24:11,836 --> 00:24:14,516
Thunderdome. How
do I get in there?

183
00:24:14,876 --> 00:24:17,157
That's easy. Pick a fight.

184
00:24:54,603 --> 00:24:56,723
Everybody have a good time.

185
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:02,884
That's my vehicle
and I want it back.

186
00:25:03,404 --> 00:25:05,885
Hearing wonky.
Sounds like an order.

187
00:25:06,845 --> 00:25:07,885
That's right.

188
00:25:08,405 --> 00:25:12,566
Yumping Yesus. Him
sad. Brain broken.

189
00:25:14,406 --> 00:25:16,086
Me explain.

190
00:25:16,927 --> 00:25:19,727
This my vehicle. You...

191
00:25:20,247 --> 00:25:21,927
pedestrian.

192
00:25:26,408 --> 00:25:27,568
Three seconds...

193
00:25:27,928 --> 00:25:29,769
break neck. One...

194
00:25:40,251 --> 00:25:41,611
MasterBlaster.

195
00:25:42,091 --> 00:25:44,251
Listen to the law.

196
00:25:44,611 --> 00:25:47,932
Aunty, two men in dispute.

197
00:25:51,332 --> 00:25:53,613
These our witness, Aunty.

198
00:25:53,973 --> 00:25:57,453
Us suffer bad. Us want justice.

199
00:25:57,974 --> 00:26:00,774
We want Thunderdome.

200
00:26:01,294 --> 00:26:05,295
You know the law. Two
men enter one man leaves.

201
00:26:07,975 --> 00:26:12,976
This Blaster. Twenty men
enter, only him leave.

202
00:26:13,496 --> 00:26:16,457
Then it's your
choice. Thunderdome.

203
00:26:49,862 --> 00:26:52,863
Aunty. Aunty.

204
00:26:56,343 --> 00:27:00,344
Welcome to another
edition of Thunderdome.

205
00:27:24,908 --> 00:27:27,229
Listen on. Listen on.

206
00:27:27,949 --> 00:27:29,709
This is the truth of it.

207
00:27:30,069 --> 00:27:34,230
Fighting leads to killing,
and killing gets to warring.

208
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:37,750
And that was damn near
the death of us all.

209
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:43,071
Look at us now, busted up and
everyone talking about hard rain.

210
00:27:43,591 --> 00:27:48,232
But we've learnt by the dust of
them all. Bartertown's learnt.

211
00:27:48,752 --> 00:27:52,073
Now when men get to
fighting, it happens here.

212
00:27:52,433 --> 00:27:54,433
And it finishes here.

213
00:27:54,753 --> 00:27:58,754
Two men enter, one man leaves.

214
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:27,119
And right now, I've got two men.

215
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:30,639
Two men with a gut full of fear.

216
00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:35,960
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls...

217
00:28:38,481 --> 00:28:40,801
dying time's here.

218
00:28:42,481 --> 00:28:45,802
He's the ball cracker.
Death on foot.

219
00:28:46,322 --> 00:28:50,323
You know him. You love
him. He's Blaster.

220
00:29:02,765 --> 00:29:05,005
The challenger, direct
from out of the Wasteland.

221
00:29:05,325 --> 00:29:08,326
He's bad. He's
beautiful. He's crazy.

222
00:29:09,366 --> 00:29:12,166
It's the man with no name.

223
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:11,256
Thunderdome's simple. Get to the
weapons, use them anyway you can.

224
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:15,097
I know you won't break the
rules. There aren't any.

225
00:30:20,658 --> 00:30:21,858
Remember where you are.

226
00:30:23,058 --> 00:30:24,418
This is Thunderdome.

227
00:30:24,938 --> 00:30:29,619
Death is listening and will
take the first man that screams.

228
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,020
Prepare.

229
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:54,543
Two men enter, one man leave.

230
00:35:58,315 --> 00:36:00,275
- You know the law.
- This is Thunderdome.

231
00:36:00,475 --> 00:36:01,475
Kill him.

232
00:36:01,675 --> 00:36:04,636
No, no. Look at his face.

233
00:36:05,876 --> 00:36:07,316
He's got the mind of a child.

234
00:36:11,517 --> 00:36:13,357
It's not his fault.

235
00:36:16,678 --> 00:36:18,678
Blaster, I'm sorry.

236
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:21,198
This wasn't part of the deal.

237
00:36:21,799 --> 00:36:22,799
Deal?

238
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,159
What do you mean, "deal"?

239
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,200
You must have tasted it.
It was in your hands.

240
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,041
You had it all.

241
00:36:35,321 --> 00:36:36,841
What do you mean, "deal"?

242
00:36:41,362 --> 00:36:42,882
No more methane.

243
00:36:43,362 --> 00:36:46,043
This place... finished.

244
00:36:46,323 --> 00:36:47,643
No, little man.

245
00:36:47,963 --> 00:36:49,523
We've only just begun.

246
00:37:16,528 --> 00:37:17,568
Open it.

247
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:24,569
Two men enter. One man leave.

248
00:38:00,335 --> 00:38:02,175
What's this?

249
00:38:04,496 --> 00:38:08,977
Do you think I don't know the
law? Wasn't it me who wrote it?

250
00:38:09,297 --> 00:38:11,977
And this man has broken the law.

251
00:38:12,297 --> 00:38:14,297
Right or wrong, we had a deal.

252
00:38:14,978 --> 00:38:18,338
And the law says, "Bust
a deal, face the wheel."

253
00:38:18,658 --> 00:38:20,979
Bust a deal and face the wheel.

254
00:38:36,621 --> 00:38:39,502
All our lives hang by a thread.

255
00:38:40,022 --> 00:38:42,502
Now we've got a man
waiting for sentence.

256
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:46,183
But ain't it the truth? You
take your chances with the law.

257
00:38:46,703 --> 00:38:49,183
Justice is only a
roll of the dice...

258
00:38:49,543 --> 00:38:53,504
a flip of the coin,
a turn of the wheel.

259
00:41:15,768 --> 00:41:17,088
Fix it.

260
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:19,929
You run Bartertown.

261
00:41:20,449 --> 00:41:22,089
You fix.

262
00:41:31,131 --> 00:41:33,451
Not pigs. No.

263
00:41:54,134 --> 00:41:55,615
That's enough.

264
00:41:57,655 --> 00:42:01,296
Do you want to use him or
kill him? Bring him up.

265
00:42:15,338 --> 00:42:18,659
Master, do what Ironbar says.

266
00:42:20,019 --> 00:42:22,819
I will. Yeah, I will.

267
00:47:58,236 --> 00:47:59,876
Savannah.

268
00:48:06,237 --> 00:48:08,077
Finn, look.

269
00:48:10,078 --> 00:48:12,758
It's him. I finded him.

270
00:48:14,438 --> 00:48:16,079
It's Captain Walker.

271
00:49:00,126 --> 00:49:02,487
- What's his talk?
- He ain't made wordstuff.

272
00:49:02,807 --> 00:49:05,287
It's a long track.
Maybe he's burned out.

273
00:49:05,647 --> 00:49:08,128
Maybe. Maybe he's just listening.

274
00:49:10,488 --> 00:49:12,288
Walker? Hello?

275
00:49:14,169 --> 00:49:16,329
Maybe he's talking,
but we ain't hearing.

276
00:49:16,649 --> 00:49:18,329
You see his lips ain't moving.

277
00:49:18,649 --> 00:49:20,490
Not with wordstuff, with sonic.

278
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:23,810
That ain't never gonna
work, sonic-bonny bullshit.

279
00:49:26,851 --> 00:49:28,811
This is Delta-Fox-X-Ray.

280
00:49:29,171 --> 00:49:30,491
Can you hear me?

281
00:49:31,491 --> 00:49:33,012
Delta-Fox-X-Ray.

282
00:49:34,932 --> 00:49:36,292
Come In.

283
00:49:38,173 --> 00:49:39,853
Is anybody out there?

284
00:49:43,694 --> 00:49:45,014
Can you read me, Walker?

285
00:50:06,537 --> 00:50:08,058
What's up, Doc?

286
00:50:10,058 --> 00:50:12,218
Hey, take me with you.

287
00:50:14,739 --> 00:50:16,379
Can you hear me, Walker?

288
00:51:15,109 --> 00:51:16,949
Fly, Walker.

289
00:51:57,356 --> 00:51:58,836
Who are you?

290
00:52:00,677 --> 00:52:02,157
Quiet.

291
00:52:04,517 --> 00:52:05,997
Shut up.

292
00:52:10,358 --> 00:52:12,359
Enough.

293
00:52:51,085 --> 00:52:52,565
Who are you?

294
00:52:54,686 --> 00:52:56,086
The waiting ones.

295
00:52:56,406 --> 00:52:57,566
Waiting for what?

296
00:52:57,846 --> 00:52:59,166
Waiting for you.

297
00:53:00,687 --> 00:53:01,727
And who am I?

298
00:53:06,248 --> 00:53:08,408
I think he be testing us.

299
00:53:10,248 --> 00:53:13,249
This a testing, Walker?
You reckon we been slack?

300
00:53:14,089 --> 00:53:16,089
I don't know. Maybe
you've been slack.

301
00:53:16,769 --> 00:53:20,770
We ain't. We kept it
straight. It's all there.

302
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:25,451
Everything marked, everything
remembered. You wait, you'll see.

303
00:53:33,612 --> 00:53:36,613
This you knows. I
be First Tracker.

304
00:53:36,973 --> 00:53:39,413
Times past count I done the Tell.

305
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:44,614
But it weren't me that tumbled
Walker. It was Savannah.

306
00:53:45,294 --> 00:53:48,135
So it only right
she take the Tell.

307
00:53:50,815 --> 00:53:55,136
This ain't one body's story.
It's the story of us all.

308
00:53:55,736 --> 00:53:59,136
We got it mouth to mouth. You
got to listen it and remember.

309
00:53:59,497 --> 00:54:03,497
Because what you hears today you
got to tell the birthed tomorrow.

310
00:54:04,497 --> 00:54:06,818
I'm looking behind us now...

311
00:54:07,178 --> 00:54:09,138
across the count of time...

312
00:54:09,498 --> 00:54:13,339
down the long haul,
into history back.

313
00:54:13,659 --> 00:54:16,659
I sees the end what
were the start.

314
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:20,020
It's Pox-Eclipse, full of pain.

315
00:54:28,862 --> 00:54:33,502
And out of it were birthed
crackling dust and fearsome time.

316
00:54:33,862 --> 00:54:35,343
It were full-on winter...

317
00:54:35,703 --> 00:54:37,663
and Mr Dead chasing them all.

318
00:54:38,183 --> 00:54:42,024
But one he couldn't catch.
That were Captain Walker.

319
00:54:42,384 --> 00:54:47,025
He gathers up a gang, takes to
the air, and flies to the sky.

320
00:54:48,705 --> 00:54:53,386
So they left their homes, said
bidey-bye to the high-scrapers...

321
00:54:53,866 --> 00:54:57,386
and what were left of the
knowing, they left behind.

322
00:54:58,546 --> 00:55:00,707
Some say the wind just stoppered.

323
00:55:01,067 --> 00:55:04,387
Others reckon it were a
gang called Turbulence.

324
00:55:11,149 --> 00:55:12,629
And after the wreck...

325
00:55:12,989 --> 00:55:15,309
some had been jumped by Mr Dead...

326
00:55:15,629 --> 00:55:19,630
but some had got the luck,
and it leads them here.

327
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:22,480
One look and they's got the hots

328
00:55:22,481 --> 00:55:25,151
for it. They word
it "Planet Earth."

329
00:55:25,671 --> 00:55:29,712
And they says, "We don't need
the knowing. We can live here."

330
00:55:30,312 --> 00:55:33,472
"We don't need the
knowing. We can live here."

331
00:55:34,673 --> 00:55:37,993
Time counts and keeps counting.

332
00:55:38,553 --> 00:55:40,354
They gets missing what they had.

333
00:55:40,674 --> 00:55:44,514
They get so lonely for the
high-scrapers and the video.

334
00:55:50,195 --> 00:55:52,425
And they does the
pictures so they'd

335
00:55:52,426 --> 00:55:54,836
remember all the
knowing that they lost.

336
00:56:05,718 --> 00:56:06,878
Remember this?

337
00:56:07,118 --> 00:56:09,118
Tomorrow-morrow Land.

338
00:56:09,558 --> 00:56:11,039
Remember this?

339
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:13,199
The River of Light.

340
00:56:13,559 --> 00:56:14,719
Remember this?

341
00:56:14,999 --> 00:56:16,720
Skyraft.

342
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,040
Remember this?

343
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:20,560
Captain Walker.

344
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:21,881
Remember this?

345
00:56:22,401 --> 00:56:23,561
Mrs Walker.

346
00:56:27,241 --> 00:56:31,882
Then Captain Walker picked them of
an age and good for a long haul.

347
00:56:32,402 --> 00:56:37,083
They counted 20, and that
were them. The great leaving.

348
00:56:37,283 --> 00:56:40,404
"Rescue party departed
at first light...

349
00:56:40,724 --> 00:56:43,924
"led by Flight
Captain G.I. Walker."

350
00:56:44,124 --> 00:56:47,565
"May God have mercy on our souls."

351
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:51,245
They said bidey-bye to
them what they'd birthed.

352
00:56:51,606 --> 00:56:53,926
And from the nothing
they looked back...

353
00:56:54,246 --> 00:56:58,167
and Captain Walker hollered,
"Wait, one of us will come."

354
00:56:58,607 --> 00:57:01,527
"Wait, one of us will come."

355
00:57:03,608 --> 00:57:05,928
And somebody did come.

356
00:57:06,448 --> 00:57:08,288
Walker.

357
00:57:32,972 --> 00:57:35,293
We's heartful to
you, Captain Walker.

358
00:57:35,653 --> 00:57:38,373
We's ready now. Take us home.

359
00:57:47,655 --> 00:57:51,816
We kept it straight. Everything
marked, everything remembered.

360
00:57:52,176 --> 00:57:54,816
You kept it real good.
You ain't been slack.

361
00:57:55,176 --> 00:57:56,496
Why are we waiting for?

362
00:57:56,817 --> 00:57:58,417
You got the wrong guy.

363
00:57:58,657 --> 00:57:59,937
Quit joshing.

364
00:57:59,937 --> 00:58:00,951
Catch the wind.

365
00:58:01,152 --> 00:58:03,018
We got to see
Tomorrow-morrow Land.

366
00:58:03,338 --> 00:58:05,498
Home. Tomorrow-morrow Land.

367
00:58:11,859 --> 00:58:14,700
There were places
like these. Cities.

368
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:17,020
They were called cities.

369
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:20,781
They had lots of knowing.
They had skyscrapers...

370
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:23,781
videos, and they had the sonic.

371
00:58:26,862 --> 00:58:28,342
Then this happened.

372
00:58:28,702 --> 00:58:30,893
This Pox-Eclipse
happened, and it's

373
00:58:30,894 --> 00:58:33,023
finished. It isn't there any more.

374
00:58:34,703 --> 00:58:38,023
You got to understand
that this is home...

375
00:58:38,864 --> 00:58:41,544
and there's no Tomorrow-Land...

376
00:58:42,064 --> 00:58:43,984
and I ain't Captain Walker.

377
00:59:15,710 --> 00:59:17,430
This is it.

378
01:01:02,048 --> 01:01:03,968
We's loaded and waiting, Captain.

379
01:01:04,168 --> 01:01:07,329
We got the wind up our
arse, Captain. Let's go.

380
01:02:55,507 --> 01:02:57,667
Who's coming? We's
pulling a leaving.

381
01:02:58,187 --> 01:03:02,188
There ain't gonna be no leavings.
All that's just jerking time.

382
01:03:02,388 --> 01:03:03,788
We's working it different.

383
01:03:04,108 --> 01:03:07,189
Ain't you seen nothing? He
couldn't catch the wind.

384
01:03:07,509 --> 01:03:10,509
There weren't no skyrafting.
There won't be no salvage.

385
01:03:10,869 --> 01:03:13,630
This is our Tomorrow-morrow
Land. He's proof of that.

386
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:18,871
Program. All of you program. If he
ain't Captain Walker, who is he?

387
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:22,551
He ain't no different to
us. He slogged it on foot.

388
01:03:23,231 --> 01:03:25,392
If he can get here,
we can get back.

389
01:03:25,712 --> 01:03:27,392
He ain't much bigger than us.

390
01:03:27,712 --> 01:03:30,153
Co-pilot did it. So why can't we?

391
01:03:30,393 --> 01:03:32,713
That's the trick of
it. Who's coming?

392
01:03:33,713 --> 01:03:36,874
Across the nothing?
Don't you remember?

393
01:03:37,394 --> 01:03:40,554
When you finded him, he
were half jumped by Mr Dead.

394
01:03:40,834 --> 01:03:43,555
Nobody's saying it
ain't a hard slog.

395
01:03:43,915 --> 01:03:46,675
If we wants the knowing,
it ain't an easy ride.

396
01:03:46,875 --> 01:03:48,916
There ain't no knowing.

397
01:03:49,196 --> 01:03:51,482
There ain't no
skyraft and no sonic.

398
01:03:51,483 --> 01:03:53,397
You slog out there to nothing.

399
01:03:53,757 --> 01:03:55,077
Worse than nothing.

400
01:03:55,597 --> 01:03:58,917
The first place you'll find is
a sleaze-pit called Bartertown.

401
01:03:59,238 --> 01:04:02,598
If the earth doesn't swallow
you up, that place will.

402
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:08,919
Listen him. There ain't
no Tomorrow-morrow Land.

403
01:04:09,239 --> 01:04:10,919
We done that.

404
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,440
He's got wordstuff out his ass.

405
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:16,920
Whoever's got the
juice, track with us.

406
01:04:58,808 --> 01:05:00,368
Now listen good.

407
01:05:01,808 --> 01:05:04,334
I'm not Captain
Walker. I'm the guy

408
01:05:04,335 --> 01:05:06,649
who keeps Mr Dead in his pocket.

409
01:05:08,009 --> 01:05:10,489
And I say we're gonna stay here.

410
01:05:10,850 --> 01:05:14,850
And we'll live a long time
and we'll be thankful.

411
01:05:16,010 --> 01:05:17,010
Right?

412
01:05:18,851 --> 01:05:20,491
Keep tracking.

413
01:06:17,901 --> 01:06:19,421
Get the others.

414
01:07:20,991 --> 01:07:23,312
They've gone. You
got to get them back.

415
01:07:23,672 --> 01:07:27,673
They've gone. ScrooLoose let
them go. There're in the nothing.

416
01:07:27,993 --> 01:07:29,913
Come on, you got to help me.

417
01:07:30,153 --> 01:07:32,313
You got to help me get them back.

418
01:07:34,834 --> 01:07:36,834
Savannah and Gekko.
He can hardly walk.

419
01:07:37,114 --> 01:07:38,838
Little Finn, Mr Skyfish, and

420
01:07:38,839 --> 01:07:41,115
Cusha. She's gonna
pop any day now.

421
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,360
- How long?
- Half a night.

422
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:12,600
Maybe less.

423
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:15,561
- They be deep in the nothing.
- Without much water.

424
01:08:15,721 --> 01:08:19,201
It makes no difference. They'll
be swallowed up by the sand.

425
01:08:19,481 --> 01:08:20,962
Get them back, Captain.

426
01:08:21,402 --> 01:08:24,882
Stop with the "Captain."
Stop the noise.

427
01:08:32,083 --> 01:08:33,524
I need as much water
as I can carry.

428
01:08:47,766 --> 01:08:48,926
What are you doing?

429
01:08:49,126 --> 01:08:51,407
I's coming salvage for my buddies.

430
01:08:53,487 --> 01:08:55,207
We needs a hunter.

431
01:10:28,383 --> 01:10:30,583
He holds his own, okay?

432
01:11:42,115 --> 01:11:43,796
Help. Help me.

433
01:13:21,212 --> 01:13:23,052
Quick, let's trek.

434
01:13:36,735 --> 01:13:38,575
Is it Tomorrow-morrow Land?

435
01:13:39,215 --> 01:13:41,576
No. Bartertown.

436
01:13:42,736 --> 01:13:44,576
It's our only chance.

437
01:13:45,576 --> 01:13:47,577
Get in, we're right behind you.

438
01:13:47,897 --> 01:13:50,057
Wait. Stick together.

439
01:13:50,417 --> 01:13:51,737
Where are we?

440
01:13:53,097 --> 01:13:54,097
It's Bartertown.

441
01:13:54,418 --> 01:13:56,418
It stinks.

442
01:13:56,898 --> 01:13:59,339
Tubba, Cusha, wait up.

443
01:14:01,339 --> 01:14:02,699
Which way?

444
01:14:03,259 --> 01:14:04,939
Head for the light.

445
01:14:09,260 --> 01:14:10,740
Where are the others?

446
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:12,261
They've gone ahead.

447
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:15,101
- How far?
- A long way.

448
01:14:15,421 --> 01:14:18,262
- Can you see them?
- Only just.

449
01:14:24,103 --> 01:14:26,263
What are we doing?
What's our program?

450
01:14:26,623 --> 01:14:28,103
We're looking for someone.

451
01:14:28,303 --> 01:14:30,624
In here? This is jerking time.

452
01:14:30,904 --> 01:14:34,624
A little guy with the knowing
of a lot of things. Understand?

453
01:14:35,305 --> 01:14:36,945
Well, shut up.

454
01:14:37,625 --> 01:14:39,305
What's to see, Captain?

455
01:14:39,625 --> 01:14:40,785
Quiet.

456
01:14:48,627 --> 01:14:51,467
It's him, Captain.
It's the little guy.

457
01:14:51,827 --> 01:14:54,308
Little? He's the smallest.

458
01:14:54,508 --> 01:14:57,188
What the fuck, Captain.
What use is he?

459
01:14:57,428 --> 01:14:58,668
Quiet.

460
01:15:01,309 --> 01:15:03,669
- Where are the others?
- Out there.

461
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:07,240
Screwy, let's fly.

462
01:16:40,286 --> 01:16:41,446
Excuse me.

463
01:17:34,775 --> 01:17:36,015
Hold it.

464
01:17:38,695 --> 01:17:42,496
Remember... no matter where
you go, there you are.

465
01:18:34,505 --> 01:18:35,745
Hi.

466
01:19:21,953 --> 01:19:24,113
All aboard.

467
01:20:20,683 --> 01:20:21,683
Go.

468
01:20:22,883 --> 01:20:24,363
Hang on.

469
01:21:48,297 --> 01:21:50,978
Chase now, pay later.

470
01:22:12,942 --> 01:22:13,942
Bartertown.

471
01:22:14,502 --> 01:22:15,982
Listen to me.

472
01:22:19,663 --> 01:22:21,143
Where are you gonna run?

473
01:22:21,503 --> 01:22:24,824
Where are you gonna
hide? Listen to me.

474
01:22:25,344 --> 01:22:27,344
Bartertown will live.

475
01:22:28,024 --> 01:22:29,664
Find the little man.

476
01:22:30,024 --> 01:22:32,665
Bring him back to me... alive.

477
01:22:33,345 --> 01:22:35,185
We will rebuild.

478
01:22:38,346 --> 01:22:41,706
For those who took
him... no mercy.

479
01:23:26,234 --> 01:23:28,234
So, what's the plan?

480
01:23:29,915 --> 01:23:30,915
Plan?

481
01:23:31,715 --> 01:23:33,635
There ain't no plan.

482
01:23:57,599 --> 01:23:58,959
Skyfish, look.

483
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:03,600
It's got to be.

484
01:24:08,281 --> 01:24:09,801
The sonic.

485
01:24:10,961 --> 01:24:12,802
Gekko got it straight.

486
01:24:13,122 --> 01:24:14,442
Delta-Fox-X-Ray.

487
01:24:14,962 --> 01:24:16,082
Come in.

488
01:24:36,326 --> 01:24:39,646
Welcome. Open your
book at page one.

489
01:24:42,167 --> 01:24:45,007
Now repeat after me. Bonjour.

490
01:24:46,687 --> 01:24:48,008
Good morning.

491
01:24:53,529 --> 01:24:55,169
Where are you going?

492
01:25:02,690 --> 01:25:04,530
I am going home.

493
01:25:33,335 --> 01:25:34,736
He's got the man.

494
01:27:27,795 --> 01:27:29,275
Ah, Pigkiller.

495
01:29:08,812 --> 01:29:11,292
Blackfinger. Pull the pin.

496
01:29:11,972 --> 01:29:13,652
Do it now.

497
01:29:16,333 --> 01:29:17,973
Hold it, Blackfinger.

498
01:29:33,336 --> 01:29:34,456
Give him back.

499
01:29:34,776 --> 01:29:35,856
Let go.

500
01:29:36,856 --> 01:29:38,857
Blackfinger, let go.

501
01:29:39,057 --> 01:29:40,977
I've got you now,
and I'm going home.

502
01:29:43,457 --> 01:29:44,858
You'll be all right.

503
01:30:20,184 --> 01:30:21,184
Come on now.

504
01:31:07,992 --> 01:31:10,312
We're gonna count to 3.

505
01:31:16,993 --> 01:31:18,473
What happened to 2?

506
01:31:35,916 --> 01:31:37,957
This is a stickup.

507
01:31:38,237 --> 01:31:41,717
Anybody moves, and
they're dead meat.

508
01:31:47,358 --> 01:31:49,839
I think we're all dead meat.

509
01:32:31,246 --> 01:32:33,726
Dad. We're dead meat.

510
01:32:36,247 --> 01:32:39,087
Quick, get in the plane.

511
01:32:42,087 --> 01:32:43,528
Which way did he go?

512
01:32:43,768 --> 01:32:45,488
I warned you, Dad.

513
01:32:55,130 --> 01:32:56,130
You.

514
01:32:56,170 --> 01:32:57,170
Me?

515
01:32:57,610 --> 01:32:59,650
You. It's your lucky day.

516
01:33:00,171 --> 01:33:01,171
It is?

517
01:33:01,931 --> 01:33:03,011
You got a plane.

518
01:33:03,531 --> 01:33:04,531
I have?

519
01:33:09,612 --> 01:33:11,372
It might just save your life.

520
01:33:12,453 --> 01:33:13,453
It will?

521
01:33:41,658 --> 01:33:44,018
All right, let her go.

522
01:33:51,859 --> 01:33:53,299
What's the problem?

523
01:33:53,540 --> 01:33:55,820
We're not gonna
get off the ground.

524
01:33:56,020 --> 01:33:57,460
We're overloaded.

525
01:34:28,585 --> 01:34:31,746
Dad, you better do something.

526
01:35:10,873 --> 01:35:13,353
- Kick her in the guts.
- Not gonna make it.

527
01:35:13,713 --> 01:35:14,993
Not enough runway.

528
01:35:15,193 --> 01:35:16,754
We haven't got any choice.

529
01:35:17,034 --> 01:35:18,034
Between them...

530
01:35:18,434 --> 01:35:21,274
and us, there's not enough runway.

531
01:35:24,435 --> 01:35:25,795
There will be.

532
01:38:03,942 --> 01:38:05,902
Ain't we a pair...

533
01:38:06,582 --> 01:38:07,942
raggedy-man.

534
01:38:17,144 --> 01:38:18,664
Goodbye, soldier.

535
01:40:18,444 --> 01:40:21,965
This you knows. The
years travel fast.

536
01:40:22,485 --> 01:40:25,285
And time after time
I've done the Tell.

537
01:40:25,806 --> 01:40:29,766
But this ain't one body's
Tell. It's the Tell of us all.

538
01:40:30,326 --> 01:40:32,967
And you got to listen
it and remember.

539
01:40:33,487 --> 01:40:38,128
Because what you hears today, you
got to tell the newborn tomorrow.

540
01:40:38,808 --> 01:40:42,808
I's looking behind us
now, into history back.

541
01:40:43,168 --> 01:40:45,065
I sees those of us that got the

542
01:40:45,066 --> 01:40:47,329
luck and started
the haul for home.

543
01:40:47,649 --> 01:40:50,570
It lead us here and
we was heartful...

544
01:40:50,770 --> 01:40:52,850
because we seen
what there once was.

545
01:40:53,850 --> 01:40:57,171
One look, and we knewed
we'd got it straight.

546
01:40:57,691 --> 01:41:00,056
Those who had gone
before had knowing

547
01:41:00,057 --> 01:41:02,172
of things beyond our reckoning...

548
01:41:02,532 --> 01:41:04,492
even beyond our dreaming.

549
01:41:06,012 --> 01:41:08,853
Time counts and keeps counting.

550
01:41:09,693 --> 01:41:11,333
And we knows now...

551
01:41:11,693 --> 01:41:15,694
finding the trick of what's been
and lost ain't no easy ride.

552
01:41:16,534 --> 01:41:19,695
But that's our track.
We got to travel it.

553
01:41:20,055 --> 01:41:22,855
And there ain't nobody
knows where it's gonna lead.

554
01:41:24,055 --> 01:41:27,856
Still and all, every
night we does the Tell...

555
01:41:28,216 --> 01:41:32,217
so that we remember who we
was and where we came from.

556
01:41:33,057 --> 01:41:36,537
But most of all we remembers
the man who finded us...

557
01:41:37,218 --> 01:41:39,218
him that came the salvage.

558
01:41:39,578 --> 01:41:42,738
And we lights the city.
Not just for him...

559
01:41:43,059 --> 01:41:45,739
but for all of them that
are still out there.

560
01:41:46,219 --> 01:41:48,900
Because we knows
there'll come a night...

561
01:41:49,220 --> 01:41:51,380
when they sees the
distant light...

562
01:41:51,740 --> 01:41:53,740
and they'll be coming home.
